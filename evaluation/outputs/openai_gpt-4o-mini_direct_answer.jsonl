Of note, he had a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and angina. Physical examination findings included: clear consciousness; height, 163 cm; weight, 48 kg; blood pressure, 66/40 mmHg; heart rate, 75/min; respiratory rate, 22/min; oxygen saturation of peripheral artery, 96%; and body temperature, 38.1 \u00b0C. He had no surface lymphadenopathy. Laboratory findings included: white blood cell (WBC) count, 4.2 \u00d7 109/L; hemoglobin, 9.6 g/dL; platelet count, 106 \u00d7 109/L; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 1662 IU/L; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 6562 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 1407 IU/L; alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 509 IU/L; \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase (\u03b3-GTP), 130 IU/L; total bilirubin, 2.7 mg/dL; prothrombin time (PT), 20.3 s; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.73; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 34.4 mg/dL; and creatinine, 1.4 mg/dL. Serologic tests were all negative for hepatitis A, B, C, and E. Computed tomography (CT) performed at admission revealed no distinct nodules or masses in the liver, but mild splenomegaly, multiple hypodense splenic lesions, and para-aortic lymph node swelling (Fig. a\u2013c). Antibiotics were administered intravenously for suspected acute cholangitis and sepsis, but the fever persisted. Abdominal ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed 2 days later newly depicted gallbladder wall thickening and ascites (Figs. , ). On the same night, the patient presented with grade II hepatic encephalopathy, with blood tests showing a decrease in platelet count and worsening liver function suggestive of \u201cacute type\u201d ALF with hepatic coma and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). While consideration was being given to treating acute liver failure, the patient suddenly developed ventricular fibrillation and died despite immediate resuscitation measures on day 3 of hospitalization.\nGiven the rapid clinical course, an autopsy was performed in this patient with suspected ALF likely due to drug-induced liver injury, autoimmune hepatitis, hepatitis of indeterminate etiology, circulatory disturbance, metabolic disease, or malignant cells including malignant lymphoma. This led to the patient being diagnosed with malignant, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, characterized by multiple lymph-node, as well as multi-organ (i.e., spleen, liver, lung, and prostate) involvement: (1) general swelling of lymph nodes in the para-abdominal aorta (Fig. a), peripancreatic, peribronchial, pulmonary hilar, subclavicular regions, as well as in the pelvis, especially around the iliac arteries, measuring up to 60 mm in diameter; (2) presence of multiple whitish splenic nodules (Fig. b) with the entire spleen shown to be microscopically infiltrated by tumor cells (Fig. a); (3) irregular geographical morphology of the liver (Fig. c) with the lymphoma cells mainly infiltrating the portal areas (Fig. b); (4) involvement of the right lobe of the lung; (5) involvement of both lobes of the prostate consequent to outer connective tissue involvement (Fig. c). Microscopically, the tumor cells in the lymph nodes were shown to have medium-sized irregular nuclei and small nucleoli with a high nuclear cytoplasmic ratio, thus showing diffuse proliferation characterized by the presence of large numbers of small T-cells (Fig. ). Immunohistochemistry revealed the tumor cells to be positive for CD20 (Fig. a), CD79a (Fig. b), bcl-2 (Fig. c), and MUM1 (Fig. d), but negative for CD3 (Fig. e), CD10, bcl-6, and cyclin D1, with a Ki-67 labeling index (Ki-67 LI) of 16% (Fig. f).

The patient states he has had chest discomfort and food intolerance for the past week, but that his symptoms were far worse tonight. He notes no inciting event, recent trauma, or aggravating factors. On exam he appears uncomfortable, anxious, and is in a semi-tripod position. Vitals are pertinent for a heart rate of 144, systolic blood pressure in the 180 s, and oxygen saturation of 89% on 1L O2 via nasal cannula. Of note, the patient weighed 67.2 kg, and was 173 cm tall. Chart review showed that he had lost approximately 4 kg (last recorded weight in chart was 71.2 kg), since his last medical visit.\nPrimary survey was overall unremarkable. Airway was secure, patient\u2019s breathing improved with 3 L oxygen, breath sounds were present and equal bilaterally, vascular access was obtained, and GCS was 15. Intravenous pain medication was given which improved the patient\u2019s blood pressure to systolic 140 s. Given this patient\u2019s overall clinical picture, the most pressing disease processes included myocardial infarction (given history of coronary artery disease and prior infarcts), aortic dissection (given symptoms, hypertension, and medical history), pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism (the previous two diagnoses given his chest pain and decreased O2 even on 1 L of oxygen), and cardiac wall rupture (given multiple prior MIs). Other considerations include congestive heart failure, hypertensive crisis, and an underlying infection.\nLabs were drawn to include a CBC, renal panel, cardiac panel, lactate, and a type and cross. EKG was unremarkable. A chest X-ray was obtained which revealed a widened mediastinum (Fig. ).\nThe patient was stabilized, but the underlying cause of his symptoms had not yet been identified. His widened mediastinum is troubling, and further drives the differential. Aortic (dissection, aneurysm), cardiac (tamponade, wall rupture), and esophageal pathology (rupture versus other masses) now move to the top of the list of diagnoses. Labs continued to be pending. Given his now overall hemodynamically stable status and clinical improvement, the decision was made to obtain a CT chest/abdomen/pelvis which revealed the following (Fig. ).\nAlong with the CT scan; the initial set of labs resulted and were pertinent for leukocytosis (white blood cell count/WBC) of 19,000/mcL, creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, lactate of 3.94 mmol/L, and troponin of 0.101 ng/mL. Although no official read of the images were immediately available, a preliminary read by the team was concerning for mega-esophagus versus a strangulated hiatal hernia. Treatment of the pathology to limit the degree of heart strain (increased troponin), ischemia (as evidenced by the WBC and lactate), and possibility for future perforation were now the primary goals. Night Hawk radiology was contacted for an emergent read, who stated that the images were consistent with a severely dilated esophagus. No pulmonary emboli were visualized, and no other acute abnormalities were reported.\nThe findings, treatment modalities, risks, and benefits were discussed in depth with the patient. Given his dilated esophagus which was severe enough to cause him chest pain, dyspnea, alter his vitals, elevate his WBC, elevate lactate levels, and cause heart strain. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with possible video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), possible thoracotomy, possible laparoscopy, and possible laparotomy were recommended to the patient. The goal was for direct visualization of area, decompression, and repair of any defects. The patient was in full agreement with the plan, and was taken to the operating room shortly thereafter. In the mean time, given the location of the pathology and concern for developing septic picture, the patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and an antifungal.\nOn EGD, the patient\u2019s esophageal distention was found to be from a large bezoar which spanned from the broncho-aortic region of the esophagus to his lower esophageal sphincter. The bezoar was a phytobezoar, with evidence of medication and food particles (meat, vegetables) incorporated into it. The esophageal tissue appeared tenuous and appeared to be the cause of the patient\u2019s lab derangements (Fig. ).\nThe decompression was done carefully and meticulously by fragmenting the bezoar endoscopically using a snare device. About 2 h into the procedure, a repeat set of labs were drawn which showed significant improvement in his labs showing a WBC of now 7600/mcL (from 19,000/mcL), creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL (from 1.4 mg/dL), lactate of 0.86 mmol/L (from 3.94 mmol/L), and a troponin of 0.046 ng/mL (from 0.101 ng/mL). A discussion between the surgical team, anesthesia, and gastroenterology (via telephone) was done in the operating room for planning. Given his hemodynamic stability, improving lab values, and previous CT scan which showed no gross evidence of a leak, the decision was made to end the procedure for further resuscitation with plans to return to the OR for interval endoscopy to re-assess the esophagus. In the meantime, the patient was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics (to include antifungal coverage). He was kept Nil per os (NPO) and was admitted to the intensive care unit.\nThe patient remained hemodynamically normal and clinically stable throughout the night. The multi-disciplinary team determined the best course of action to be complete bezoar debridement, placement of NG tube, nutrition and medical optimization, workup for possible underlying esophageal pathology (to include completion EGD, manometry, and pH probe), and eventual endoscopic versus surgical management of determined condition. The above was again relayed to the patient and his family who fully supported the plan. The bezoar debridement was completed, and the esophagus was inspected for luminal integrity. An NG tube was able to be carefully placed under direct visualization.\nThe patient did well and was eventually able to be downgraded to the regular surgical floor. During his stay, a gastrostomy tube was obtained for feeding access and nutritional optimization. He would undergo several follow-up EGDs during his hospitalization to completely clear the bezoar and assess the esophageal lumen (Figs. and ). After discharge, the patient was further worked up and was found to have achalasia and esophagitis. Thorough workup includes a barium swallow study (patient\u2019s barium swallow shown in Fig. ), EGD, manometry, pH study, and a chest CT (for, among other things, surgical planning). He was followed up in the outpatient setting for further management.", "Question": "What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

She had poliomyelitis when she was very young, and there was nothing special regarding her family or psychosocial history. Serology was positive for perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA) and negative for anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA). Her condition was refractory to steroids and complicated by Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Ultimately, she underwent sub-total colectomy and ileostomy in February 2015. Pathological examination of the resection specimen showed diffuse pan-colitis consistent with UC and no indications of Crohn\u2019s disease (Fig. ). She did well in the following 11 months; prednisone was tapered and stopped within 2 months, and she gained 5 kg of weight after the ileostomy. In January 2016, a scheduled restorative ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) with proximal neo-ileostomy was performed.\nFrom one month after the IPAA, her 24-h stool collection slowly increased to 1.5\u20132 L. Next, she noticed decreased urine output since April. In early May 2016, she presented to our emergency room with repeated unconsciousness over the course of 10 days. Her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure (BP), 74/50 mmHg; heart rate (HR), 90 bpm; additionally, she exhibited a poor nutritional status (160 cm; 39 kg). On physical examination, active bowel sounds were noticed to occur approximately 7\u20139 times per minute. Her serum creatinine level was 183 \u03bcmol/L, indicating acute kidney injury. Treatment with fluid replacement and noradrenaline maintained her BP at 80\u201390/50\u201360 mmHg and gradually normalized her creatinine level. However, her 24-h watery stool collection persisted, and she developed fever and vomiting. While many leukocytes were found in stool collected from the diverted ileostomy, repeated stool cultures and tests for Clostridium difficile toxins were negative. Tests for CMV-DNA, CMV-pp65 and EBV-DNA were performed and were all negative. The patient was not on any medications, including NSAIDs, upon verification. Her treatment with steroids was stopped before the end of April 2015. Empirical treatment with antibiotics, including ceftazidime, metronidazole and oral vancomycin, was administered with no response. Due to her reliance on noradrenaline, relative adrenal insufficiency was suspected, and hydrocortisone was initiated at 50 mg q6 h intravenously. Her stool volume decreased to less than 500 ml per day quickly, by which time the treatment with noradrenaline was successfully stopped. The levels of D-lactate, endotoxin and diamine oxidase indicated that the barrier function of the intestine was compromised and that bacterial translocation may have occurred. Oedematous inflamed mucosa with patchy superficial ulcers was observed in the diverted pouch by pouchoscopy. Although an upper endoscopy and an endoscopy through a stoma revealed a normal gross appearance in the stomach, duodenum and pre-stomal ileum (Fig. a, b), the histological examination of tissue biopsies of both the duodenum and pre-stomal ileum revealed enteritis, as indicated by moderate villous atrophy, cryptitis, decreased goblet cells, and severe active inflammation with neutrophil infiltration in the lamina propria, as well as negativity for intraepithelial lymphocytosis (Fig. a-d). From these lines of evidence of histological enteritis presenting in the duodenum, pre-stomal ileum and diverted pouch, we considered pan-enteritis to be present, and we diagnosed the patient with post-colectomy enteritis. The patient was treated with methylprednisolone at 30 mg intravenously once a day with tapering by 5 mg every 7 to 10 days; however, her stool volume from the ileostomy still gradually increased to 3\u20134 L. After a multidisciplinary team discussion, ileostomy closure was debated as the final rescue treatment and was performed in August 2016. Two months later, her stool volume decreased to less than 1 L per day, and she gained 2.5 kg of weight. Azathioprine at 50 mg/d was prescribed during the tapering of prednisone. Until the last follow-up in March 2018, she performed well, with an increase in body weight to 50 kg, and daily defecation approximately 5\u20136 times at less than 1 L/day, sometimes with form (Additional file ). Gastroduodenal endoscopy and pouchoscopy were repeated annually and showed normal villi in the descending duodenum and neo-ileum in March 2018 (Fig. c, d).

We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of creatinine from \u00b5mol to mg. The mass of creatinine is 183.0 \u00b5mol. To convert 183.0 \u00b5mol of creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 183.0 \u00b5mol creatinine * 1e-06 mol/\u00b5mol = 0.000183 mol creatinine. To convert from mol creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.000183 mol creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.021 g creatinine. To convert 0.021 g of creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.021 g creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 21.0 mg creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 21.0 mg creatinine/10.0 dL = 2.1 mg creatinine/dL.

Endometrial ablation and dissection of the submucosal myoma were performed within 70 min by monopolar resection. The duration of the procedure was prolonged due to the reduced visibility caused by excessive bleeding and cervical leakage of distension medium, which impeded proper expansion of the uterine cavity. The ventilation pressure increased slowly and continuously 60 min subsequent to the start of surgery. The compliance of the lungs, as well as the achievable minute volume within the acceptable airway pressure limit of 2 kPa, decreased. It was presumed that the level of anaesthesia was insufficient and was followed by the increased administration of propofol (10 mg/kg/h). The additional inhalation of fenoterol did, however, not improve the situation. As ventilation continued to be difficult, the laryngeal mask was replaced by a 7.0 cm (inside diameter) cuffed tube subsequent to the administration of 100 mg succinylcholine as a muscle relaxant. Approximately 50 mL of a foamy, transparent liquid was aspirated from the trachea. Testing with litmus paper indicated an alkaline pH and, therefore, not the aspiration of gastric content. The amount of the pulmonary oedema increased and, despite high levels of peak airway pressures at this point approximately 3 kPa (= set peak pressure limit), adequate ventilation was not possible. Blood gas and electrolyte analyses indicated acidosis, as well as a severe hyponatremia (pH 7.11; Na 74 mEq/L; partial pressure of CO2 49.9 mmHg; saturation of O2 97 % at FiO2 1.0). Cardiopulmonary changes remained minimal. 40 mg of furosemide and 500 mL of 3 % NaCl solution were immediately administered at an infusion rate of 500 mL/h, with constant monitoring for electrolyte changes. As the patient showed clinical signs of impaired haemostasis, the operation procedure was stopped. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit with continuous administration of 3 % NaCl at a rate of 50 mL/h and electrolyte control. Plasma sodium levels increased from 74 mEq/L to 103 mEq/L after one hour, and to 130 mEq/L after 7 h (Fig. ). All together 800 mL of 3 % NaCl solution were administered within 7 h totalling at 24 g. Subsequently, sodium replenishment was stopped and the patient was extubated without problems. Immediate neurological assessment revealed no detectable deficits. 20 h after the onset of hyponatremia, the patient\u2019s sodium levels returned to within the normal range. Until then, the cumulative renal excretion was 8.5 L. 9 L of distension medium was used intraoperatively with a calculated uptake of 5 L.

His medical history was unremarkable, but one year previously his gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels had risen to 271 IU/L (normal: < 30 IU/L). Prior to this, the patient had consumed 540 mL of sake three times a week, and he had been reducing the amount of alcohol he consumed for about one year. He did not smoke or take any recreational drugs. He was single, was not homosexual, and he had not had sexual intercourse for over one year.\nThe patient had undergone treatment of his internal hemorrhoids as an outpatient at a nearby hospital that comprised an aluminum potassium sulfate and tannic acid (ALTA) injection. He developed a fever of 38 \u00b0C, dark colored urine, and itchy skin on postoperative day (POD) 1, and he took loxoprofen sodium, as required. He consulted another doctor on POD 7, because the symptoms had not improved, and his blood test results led to a diagnosis of liver dysfunction. His liver dysfunction had not improved by POD 14, and he was admitted to our hospital on POD 15.\nThe patient was 167 cm tall and weighed 52.5 kg. He presented with a blood pressure of 103/59 mmHg, a heart rate of 82 beats per minute, a temperature of 36.6 \u00b0C, and 99% oxygen saturation in room air. No specific physical findings were evident during the clinical examination on the day of hospitalization, but the patient had a rash, edema, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and jaundice. The subjective symptoms, comprising the fever, dark colored urine, and itchy skin, had disappeared by POD 10.\nThe laboratory test results showed that the patient\u2019s complete blood count was almost normal with a white blood cell count of 6900 cells/\u03bcL, a hemoglobin concentration of 14.7 g/dL, a hematocrit level of 43.1%, and a platelet count of 3.98 \u00d7 105 cells/\u03bcL, but a higher percentage of eosinophils was present (6.8%) (normal: 1.0%-5.0%), which peaked at 13.9% on POD 20. The patient\u2019s serum liver enzyme and bilirubin levels were elevated at the time of admission. The aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level was 432 IU/L (normal: 10-40 IU/L), the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was 911 IU/L (normal: 10-40 IU/L), the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level was 473 IU/L (normal: 115-359 IU/L), and the total bilirubin level was 1.3 mg/dL (normal: 0.2-1.2 mg/dL). Thus, compared with the ALP level, the AST and ALT levels showed greater magnitudes of elevation. The patient\u2019s other blood test results were within the normal ranges, as follows: serum albumin: 4.0 g/dL (normal: 3.8-5.2 g/dL); serum creatinine: 0.86 mg/dL (normal: 0.65-1.09 mg/dL); C-reactive protein: 0.1 mg/dL (normal: 0-0.3 mg/dL); prothrombin time: 100% (normal: 80%-120 %); thyroid-stimulating hormone: 0.5 \u03bcIU/mL (normal: 0.34-4.04 \u03bcIU/mL); triiodothyronine: 2.98 pg/dL (normal: 2.36-5.00 pg/dL); and thyroxin: 1.18 ng/dL (normal: 0.88-1.67 ng/dL). The serological tests for autoantibodies generated weakly positive results (1:40) for anti-nuclear antibodies, and negative results for anti-smooth muscle and anti-mitochondrial antibodies. Negative results were obtained from the tests for the hepatitis B virus surface antigen, the hepatitis C virus antibody, rapid plasma reagin, the anti-Epstein-Barr virus immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody, and the anti-cytomegalovirus IgM antibody, and from the Treponema pallidum hemagglutination test. The IgG level was within the normal range at 1415 mg/dL (normal: 800-1600 mg/dL) and the IgM level was within the normal range at 100 mg/dL (normal: 60-250 mg/dL). The IgE level was elevated at 1333 mg/dL (normal: < 250 mg/dL). Chest radiography did not reveal any abnormalities. No morphological changes were evident following abdominal ultrasonography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, and abdominal computed tomography (Figure ).\nWhen the patient was hospitalized, we considered viral, alcohol-induced, autoimmune, drug-induced, biliary tract, and thyroid function-based diseases as frequent causes of acute liver dysfunction for the differential diagnosis, and, based on the patient\u2019s medical history, and the serological and imaging results, we considered that alcohol and DILI were highly likely causes of the patient\u2019s acute liver dysfunction. However, the patient had stopped drinking during the past year, so we thought that there was a high likelihood of DILI. Therefore, we began conservative treatment with a small amount of extracellular fluid replacement.\nFigure presents the patient\u2019s symptoms, laboratory test results, and treatment over the entire course. The liver transaminase and bilirubin levels decreased rapidly after admission, and the maximum levels were as follows: ALT: 950 IU/L on POD 15; AST: 470 IU/L on POD 17; and total bilirubin: 2.1 mg/dL on POD 17. The ALP and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels showed consistent downward trends from POD 7. The patient's symptoms disappeared on POD 10, and no new symptoms appeared after hospitalization. We performed a liver biopsy on POD 25, and a drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST) of the components of the ALTA injection and lidocaine on POD 28. The patient was discharged on POD 29, and he was managed as an outpatient without any prescriptions. At the time of the patient\u2019s first outpatient appointment on POD 35, his liver transaminase and bilirubin levels had declined and were almost within the normal ranges.\nFigure presents hematoxylin and eosin (H and E)-stained sections of the liver biopsy performed on POD 25. The H and E staining showed that the basic structure of the liver had been maintained without any hepatocyte dropout or disruption, and that the bile duct had not been disrupted. At a higher magnification, the H and E staining showed that the parenchymal cells were partially dilated and that a mild inflammatory cell infiltration was present in the area of the central vein. Neither eosinophil nor plasma cell infiltrations were detected within the liver tissue. Bile plugs were found at multiple sites within the parenchyma and sinusoids. Masson staining did not show the presence of liver tissue fibrosis.\nThe lymphocyte proliferation activity levels, which were determined from the DLST performed on POD 28, were 676 counts per minute (cpm) for the control and 871 cpm for the ALTA with lidocaine. The stimulation index, which was calculated as the ALTA with lidocaine cpm divided by the control cpm, was 1.29 (normal in Japanese people: < 1.8).", "Question": "What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

Two months previously, he developed symptoms of right ptosis and progressive swallowing difficulty. Based on a positive response to edrophonium and increased titers of autoantibodies to acetylcholine receptor (19.3 nmol/L; normal < 0.2 nmol/L), he was diagnosed as having MG with severity belonging to Osserman's classification IIb (ie, generalized moderate weakness and/or bulbar dysfunction). Thoracic computed tomography demonstrated glandular hyperplasia of the thymus (Fig. A). The patient was started on prednisolone 20 mg daily and pyridostigmine 60 mg three times daily. His past history included hypertension without evidence of previous myasthenic crisis or thromboembolic events (eg, history of lower limb swelling). The results of electrocardiography, pulmonary function test [eg, vital capacity: 93%], echocardiography (eg, left ventricular ejection fraction: 85.1%), chest radiography (Fig. B), and laboratory studies (eg, coagulation test) were unremarkable. On the other hand, impaired renal function [i.e., serum creatinine: 1.42 mg/dL; eGFR: 49.1 mL/min/1.73 m2] was observed after admission.\nPreoperative physical examination of the patient showed clear consciousness without respiratory distress. Vital signs included a blood pressure of 187/103 mm Hg, heart rate of 82 beats/min, and respiratory rate of 14 breaths/minute. Under real-time neuromuscular monitoring with a train-of-four (TOF) monitor (TOF-watch SX, N.V. Organon, Oss, Netherlands), anesthesia was induced with propofol (130 mg) and rocuronium (0.85 mg/kg). Following successful tracheal intubation with a double-lumen tracheal tube (Broncho-Cath; Mallinckrodt, Athlone, Ireland), general anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane, rocuronium (total dosage: 40 mg), and a continuous infusion of remifentanil. An 18-gauge peripheral intravenous line and an arterial line were introduced. The surgical time was 4 hours 15 minutes with an estimated blood loss of 100 mL. Upon completion of surgery, sugammadex 4 mg/kg was administered to reverse neuromuscular blockade, with a maximum TOF ratio of 0.93 following reversal. Additionally, intravenous morphine 8 mg was given for postoperative analgesia. After successful extubation in the operating room and resumption of spontaneous breathing, he was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for further care.\nDuring the immediate postoperative period, the patient was hemodynamically stable without respiratory distress. Because of surgical pain with a numeric rating scale of 5 (scale of 0\u201310), intravenous morphine was titrated to a total dosage of 7 mg. Forty-five minutes later, respiratory distress with drowsiness was noted. Physical examination found pinpoint pupils with a TOF ratio of 0.9. Blood gas analysis demonstrated severe hypercapnia (arterial carbon dioxide pressure: 117.7 mm Hg) and acidosis (pH: 6.996, lactate levels: 3.3 mmol/L). On suspicion of morphine overdose, intravenous naloxone was administered twice (0.08 mg each time). After 20 minutes, the patient regained consciousness and normal respiratory pattern. Subsequent blood gas analysis demonstrated hyperlactatemia (lactate levels: 6.0 mmol/L) (Fig. ) despite improvement in arterial carbon dioxide pressure and arterial oxygen pressure after naloxone administration. Taking into account the overall clinical improvement, he was transferred to ward with spontaneous breathing and stable hemodynamics after observation for 100 minutes following initial reversal of opioid overdose.\nHowever, one hour after being transferred to ward (ie, three hours after naloxone administration), he was found to exhibit consciousness loss, respiratory distress, and pinpoint pupils. Intravenous naloxone 0.4 mg was given, followed by endotracheal intubation and transfer to the intensive care unit for mechanical ventilatory support. Brain computed tomography showed no intracranial lesion. He regained consciousness two hours after naloxone administration in the intensive care unit without symptoms of opioid withdrawal (eg, pulmonary edema). As weaning from mechanical ventilation was difficult on POD 3, a diagnosis of POMC was made. Steroid therapy (prednisolone 40 mg twice daily) and pyridostigmine (60 mg 3 times a day) was initiated.

Consciousness at the time of the attack was clear, systolic blood pressure was 120 mmHg, heart rate was 80/min with sinus rhythm, and SpO2 was 89% (O2 10 L). The pain extended to the extremities. The 12-lead ECG at the time of the attack was not significantly different from that at the time of admission (Figure ). Chest radiography showed worsening pulmonary congestion (Figure ). Echocardiography and blood sampling showed no marked change from that on admission, no increase in cardiac enzymes, and no findings strongly suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. When respiratory management by noninvasive positive pressure ventilation was continued, symptoms improved after approximately one hour. Although serum calcium and magnesium levels were not measured at the time of admission, additional examinations revealed hypocalcemia with a calcium level of 4.9 mg/dL and hypomagnesemia with a magnesium level of 1.7 mg/dL. The phosphorus level was 6.3 mg/dL. It was considered that the symptoms were due to a tetanic seizure. The cause of hypocalcemia was thought to be chronic kidney disease (CKD) because parathyroid function, as reflected by intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), was preserved (122.7 pg/mL) despite prior operation on the thyroid gland. Since the level of consciousness and symptoms did not deteriorate, calcium correction was started by oral administration while magnesium was corrected by drip infusion. The patient rapidly responded to intravenous infusion of magnesium and oral administration of calcium and vitamin D preparations. Serum calcium normalized on day 6 of hospitalization and the corrected calcium level was 9.1 mg/dL at the time of discharge. The QTc on ECG decreased from 556 to 491 ms (Figure ). The electrolyte abnormality improved without subsequent recurrence of tetany. The LVEF by echocardiography improved from 15% to 27% at the time of discharge. Although coronary angiography was not performed because of renal dysfunction, the LV contraction failure may have been affected by hypocalcemia. Her heart failure was well controlled with tolvaptan 15 mg, azosemide 90 mg, furosemide 20 mg and and bisoprolol 0.625 mg (Figure ), and she left hospital on the 13th day of hospitalization.", "Question": "What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

In the past 3 years, coil embolization of the hepatic artery and percutaneous drainage of liver cysts had been performed. After the liver cyst drainage, biliary peritonitis occurred and she was treated with antibiotics.\nPreoperative computed tomography revealed remarkable abdominal distension caused by an enlarged polycystic liver (). Results of laboratory tests were as follows: hemoglobin (Hb), 10.1 g/dL; platelet (Plt) count, 27.4 \u00d7 104/\u03bcL; albumin, 2.2 g/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 31.3 mg/dL; creatinine, 0.90 mg/dL; total bilirubin, 0.31 mg/dL; alanine transaminase, 13 U/L; aspartate transaminase, 15 U/L; prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR), 1.18; activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), 30.0 sec; fibrinogen, 573 mg/dL. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm, and transthoracic echocardiography showed normal cardiac function. Portal hypertension was not predicted. The surgeons pointed out a risk of bleeding because of surgical difficulties due to PLD and strong adhesion induced by peritonitis. Blood loss anticipated by the surgeon was 15000 ml. The transfusion unit was preoperatively informed about the possibility of massive transfusion. We ordered 5,600 mL of O type red blood cells (RBC), 4,800 mL of AB type fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 800 mL of AB type platelet concentrate (PC).\nAfter induction of general anesthesia, three 18-gauge peripheral catheters, a 12-gauge triple-lumen central venous catheter, and a pulmonary arterial catheter were placed. Since total clamping of the inferior vena cava requiring veno-veno bypass might be necessary, two 4-Fr introducer sheaths were placed at the femoral vein and the intrajugular vein. Soon after the start of surgery, massive bleeding of more than 4,000 mL/hr occurred (). We started massive transfusion of FFP at a ratio of about 1 : 1 with RBC. We also transfused 5% albumin and restricted the crystalloid solution. Reinfusion of salvaged blood and use of veno-veno bypass with retrieved blood from the operative field were avoided because many cysts of the PLD ruptured during surgery and the blood in the operative field was contaminated by the cystic content. We constantly ordered blood products and communicated with the transfusion unit.\nThe bleeding rate increased as the surgery progressed because bleeding occurred from the area where the tissue was detached from adhesion. Body temperature rapidly decreased despite the use of a rapid infusion and fluid warming system (Level 1 Fast Flow Fluid Warmer, Smiths Medical ASD Inc., Rockland, MA, USA) through 4-Fr introducer sheaths. Although catecholamine administration and massive transfusion from 5 venous lines including the introducer sheath were performed by many anesthesiologists, it was extremely difficult to maintain blood pressure and a critical situation with a risk of cardiac arrest continued due to hypotension. In addition, even though administration of insulin and calcium was performed, electrolyte disturbances of K+ of 6.3 mEq/L and Ca2+ of 2.1 mg/dL (normal range: 4.6\u20135.3 mg/dL) with peaked T wave and prolongation of QTc interval (557 msec) occurred (Figures and ). At that time, we visually noticed that the QT interval was shortened in response to bolus calcium administration, and we therefore displayed the QTc interval on a bedside monitor (CSM-1000 series Life Scope G, Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan) and used the change of real-time QTc interval as a supportive indicator for calcium correction (maximum rate: 120 mEq/hr) combined with blood gas analysis. The hepatectomy was performed without veno-veno bypass 4.5 hours after the start of surgery and the bleeding rate at that time was 15,000 mL/hr (). The excised polycystic liver weighed 10.0 kg.\nUntil portal reperfusion, we continued massive transfusion (approximately 12,000 mL/hr) including 300 mL of PC and sodium bicarbonate with additional fluid warming systems. After portal reperfusion, the bleeding rate gradually decreased and the hemodynamic variables and electrolyte disturbance improved (Figures and ; ). After anastomosis of the hepatic artery, 1 g of tranexamic acid was administered. Except for PC, which was transported from transfusion centers in our region and/or neighboring regions, the supply of blood products was not interrupted and coagulation factors were maintained throughout the surgery by administration of FFP and 3 g of fibrinogen with at least 1.26 of PT-INR, 43.6 sec of APTT, and 116 mg/dL of fibrinogen (). The abdomen was packed with gauzes and closed because complete hemostasis was difficult. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Soon after arrival at the ICU, she responded to command. On postoperative day (POD) 2, second-look surgery was performed for removal of packed gauzes. She was extubated on POD 3 without pulmonary edema or cardiac overload.\nThe duration of surgery was 16 hours and 53 minutes and the duration of general anesthesia was 22 hours and 27 minutes. Throughout the surgery, anesthesia was maintained with 1.5% sevoflurane, 0.16\u20130.33 \u03bcg\u22121 \u30fbkg\u22121 \u30fbmin\u22121 of remifentanil, and intermittent fentanyl administration (total of 1.5 mg). Bispectral IndexTM (Aspect Medical Systems, Norwood, MA, USA) values were between 30 and 60. Cardiac index was between 1.2 and 2.8 L\u22121 \u30fbmin\u22121 \u30fbm\u22122. A total of 742 mEq of calcium ion, 750 mL of 7% sodium bicarbonate, and 18 units of insulin were administered. Postoperative analysis of the relationship between QTc interval and Ca2+ during surgery showed a strong negative correlation (). Representative laboratory data are shown in . Total infusion volume was 88,560 mL (crystalloid solution: 3,450 mL; 6% hydroxyethyl starch: 3,500 mL; 5% albumin: 10,490 mL; RBC: 34,160 mL; FFP: 34,600 mL; PC: 2,400 mL), and total output volume was 86,350 mL (estimated volume of blood loss including ascites and cystic fluid: 81,600 mL; urine output: 4,750 mL); therefore, intraoperative fluid balance was +2,210 mL.

{"Row Number": 11, "Calculator Name": "Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)", "Calculator ID": "2", "Category": "lab", "Note ID": "pmc-6331344-1", "Patient Note": "A 66-year-old Japanese male was admitted to the authors\u2019 hospital for fever and abdominal pain. He had a past history of multiple renal cysts, chronic renal failure on chronic hemodialysis for 2 years, and multiple liver cysts due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). He showed the relapse of infection of liver cysts and received longtime antibiotics therapies.\nOn admission, his vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 39.4 \u00b0C; heart rate, 101 beats per minutes (bpm); and respiratory rate, 20 bpm. Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7480 cells/mm3 with a high neutrophil count of 90.7%, and a C reactive protein of 18.08 mg/dl. He was diagnosed as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) showed an abnormal high intensity at the multiple liver cysts, indicating that polycystic infection was strongly suspected. Although antibiotic therapy with intravenous meropenem at a dose of 0.5 g/day was started, fever and inflammatory reactions were unable to improve. Therefore, percutaneous echo-guided drainage was introduced for the most accumulated liver cyst. Because of the improvements of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, the drainage tube was removed at 19 days after drainage. However, the low-grade fever and inflammatory reactions recurred, and the discontinuation of antibiotic therapy was difficult. Because the most of the liver showed multilocular cystic changes, the control of infection was considered to be difficult by conservative treatments such as a local drainage or a partial liver resection, and the severe infection was expected to be repeated in the future.\nAs a fundamental treatment, a surgical approach was considered to be necessary, and a liver transplantation surgery was considered to be an indication for the disease. Therefore, he was planned to undergo living-donor liver transplantation with a right lobe graft from his wife. The graft was selected with considering a graft-to-recipient weight ratio of 0.88%, which is larger than the minimal recommended ratio of 0.8%.\nBefore the liver transplantation, he was 168.0 cm tall and weighed 68 kg. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly extending below the level of the umbilicus. Laboratory data showed anemia (Hb 10.4 g/dL), and the elevation of C-reactive protein (2.61 mg/dL). Liver and renal profiles were as follows: total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 17 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 10 U/L; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.3; creatinine, 5.09 mg/dL. His Child-Pugh score was 7 (grade B), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 22. Arterial blood gas analysis showed that blood pH was 7.44, PaCO2 32.9 mmHg, PaO2, 82.1 mmHg in room air, and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient (A-aDO2) was increased to 26.8 mmHg. Chest X-ray revealed an elevation of right diaphragm. Computed tomography (CT) showed hepatomegaly with multiple liver cysts, multiple renal cysts, mild ascites, and no abnormal findings in the lung (Fig. ). Respiratory function test showed the forced vital capacity (FVC) was mildly reduced down to 72% of predicted value, and the adjusted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLco) by Cotes\u2019 method was moderately reduced down to 57.8% of predicted value. Venous ultrasonography revealed lower extremity venous thrombosis, and the day before the operation, an inferior vena cava filter was inserted by a right internal-jugular-vein approach without any complications. At 114 days after admission, a living related liver transplantation was performed. After endotracheal intubation, two central venous catheters were inserted from left and right internal jugular veins before surgery without any complications.\nGeneral anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. The artificial ventilation was uneventful, and the airway pressure was kept below 30 cmH2O during the intraoperative period.\nThe abdominal cavity was reached through the upper abdominal reverse-T incision. The liver was found to swell markedly and to push the right diaphragm upward. Although the liver was firmly adhered to the right diaphragm, the adhesion was sharply dissected by electrocautery under appropriate traction. After the extraction of the liver, the right diaphragm was found to swell markedly and occupy the abdominal cavity. Although there was no significant change in the vital signs, the right pneumothorax was suspected, a thoracic drain was immediately inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and continuous drainage was initiated. However, the right diaphragm distended by a massive air leak and prevented the operators from anastomosing the liver vessels and the bile duct. Therefore, a small relaxing incision was made in the right diaphragm for depressurizing the right thoracic cavity and making an adequate operative field to anastomose. Thoracoscopic observation was performed through the diaphragm incision. There was no adhesion in the right thoracic cavity, and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the right lung was widely expanded like a giant cyst due to dissection from the lung parenchyma, and a marked air leak was recognized from a pin hole in the dissected pleura. Since controlling the air leakage in the patient was considered difficult only by drainage, a leakage closure operation was decided to be performed after the completion of the liver transplantation. Following the transplantation procedure, the thoracoscopic leakage closure operation was performed for the patient in the supine position.\nDuring operation, a thoracoscope was inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and endoscopic surgical instruments were inserted through the small diaphragm incision (Fig. ). The expanded visceral pleura was incised by electrocautery to drain air and pooled blood in the cyst, and bleeding sites in the lung parenchyma were identified and controlled by electric coagulation. Because the lung parenchyma and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the lung was widely dissected and the base of the cyst was large, cystectomy was found to be difficult to be performed by a stapler or sutures. For controlling the air leakage, absorbable fibrin sealant patches (TachoSil\u00ae, Baxtor Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA) were patched on the lung parenchyma under dissected visceral pleura, and fibrin glue (Beriplast P\u00ae, CSL Behring, Tokyo, Japan) was injected into the dissected space. After no air pooling was confirmed under the visceral pleura with positive pressure ventilation, polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets (Neoveil\u00ae, Gunze, Kyoto) were applied, and fibrin glue was sprayed on the visceral pleura surface (Fig. ). Finally, a 21Fr silicone thoracic tube was inserted through the right 10th intercostal space and placed on the apex of right thoracic cavity, and the diaphragm and abdominal incision was closed. Although a postoperative minor air leakage was observed, chest X-ray showed the complete expansion of the right lung. The patient was treated with water seal drainage. After the air leakage disappeared, the drainage tube was removed at 27 days after surgery. The course after liver transplantation was also smooth, and he was discharged at 67 days after surgery. The cyst on the bottom of the right lung was confirmed to disappear on chest CT after discharge (Fig. ).", "Question": "What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

He was diagnosed with hypertension at the age of 40 years, and his blood pressure was poorly controlled with a calcium channel blocker (nifedipine at 40 mg/d). He also had a past medical history of vasospastic angina and was a nonsmoker and social drinker. In addition, he had no family history of cardiovascular diseases. On admission, the patient was 168 cm tall and weighed 59 kg. He was afebrile, with a blood pressure of 161/96 mm Hg and a regular pulse of 61 beats per minute. There was no evidence of lung rales, cardiac murmurs, or an abdominal bruit. His neurological examination was unremarkable. Laboratory tests revealed that his serum creatinine level was 1.1 mg/dL, urea nitrogen level was 19 mg/dL, and serum sodium level was 140 mEq/L. He also exhibited hypokalemia with a serum potassium concentration of 2.9 mEq/L; however, he had no subjective symptoms, including muscle weakness.

Other adrenal hormone levels were within normal limits. A chest radiograph and transthoracic echocardiogram showed no significant findings. An electrocardiogram suggested nonspecific ST-T wave changes with premature atrial contractions.\nPrimary hyperaldosteronism was suspected, and therefore, a captopril challenge test and a saline infusion test were performed. All these investigations revealed positive test results (Table ), which confirmed a diagnosis of PA. A low-dose dexamethasone suppression test to exclude the diagnosis of subclinical Cushing's syndrome was negative. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, which showed a left adrenal mass (13 mm) (Figure ). In adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-stimulated AVS, although aldosterone hypersecretion was observed in the left adrenal gland, the lateralization of the disease was not determined due to incomplete cannulation of the right adrenal vein (Table ). The criteria of successful cannulation were based on the current Expert Consensus Statement.\n131I-adosterol scintigraphy under dexamethasone suppression showed an equivalently increased uptake in both adrenal glands (Figure ). Because we could not exclude the bilateral PA, including aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) with microadenoma in the right adrenal gland, we performed the medical therapy with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA). Although we administrated multiple antihypertensive agents including an MRA (eplerenone at 100 mg/d), an angiotensin II receptor blocker (azilsartan at 40 mg/d), a dual action beta blocker/alpha-1 blocker (carvedilol at 20 mg/d), a calcium channel blocker with an increased dose (nifedipine at 80 mg/d), an alpha-1 blocker (doxazosin at 2 mg/d), and an alpha-2 agonist (guanabenz at 4 mg/d), a home reading of the patient's blood pressure was above 140/90 mm Hg. Moreover, he needed a large quantity of potassium chloride to compensate for his hypokalemia.\nDespite intensive medical therapy, he underwent percutaneous coronary intervention due to stable angina. Following this, we performed AVS again, but the right adrenal vein was not successfully cannulated (Table ). We discussed further the indication for surgery and decided to remove the left adrenal gland.

CT findings revealed thickening of the arterial wall and an aneurysm of the left common iliac artery at the site of the stent (). On the basis of these findings, he was diagnosed with an infected aneurysm due to bare stent infection and underwent surgical treatment.\nThe terminal abdominal aorta and bilateral common iliac arteries were removed because the infection had extended to the aortic bifurcation (). The surrounding infected tissue was debrided, and the terminal aorta was replaced with a rifampicin-soaked bifurcated prosthesis. A pedicled omental flap based on the left gastroepiploic artery was then guided in a retrocolic fashion into the retroperitoneal cavity, to wrap the graft around its entire length.\nThe rifampicin-soaked prosthesis was prepared as follows. First, 300-mg rifampicin capsules (Sandoz Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) were dissolved in a mixture of 6-ml high-pressure sterilized polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate (Tween 80, Wako Seiyaku, Tokyo, Japan) and 54-ml distilled water.

After 3 months of admission, he suddenly showed impaired consciousness of 6 on the Glasgow Coma Scale, convulsion, and Cheyne-Stokes respiration. CT scan image did not show any cerebral hemorrhage. Exacerbation of cerebral infarction was suspected, and we started argatroban hydrate 60 mg/day, aleviatin, and non-invasive positive pressure (NPPV). Fourteen days after convulsion, he died of sudden fall in blood pressure (Fig. ).\nAn autopsy was performed, and the brain was pathologically examined. Macroscopically, massive hemorrhage in subarachnoid were seen due to rupture of basilar tip aneurysm (Fig. a, b). Autopsy diagnosis of his death was subarachnoid hemorrhage. Intravascular lumen of the basilar tip aneurysm was nearly obstructed by thrombi (Fig. c). Old cerebral infarctions were seen in the left temporal lobe and other areas. Basilar, left vertebral, bilateral carotid, bilateral middle, and bilateral post cerebral artery showed irregular dilatation of the vessel wall. A microscopic examination of the dilatation area had rupture of the internal elastic lamina and thinning of the media (Fig. d).

Her height was 155.5 cm and body weight was 61.0 kg. Laboratory data showed a creatinine of 1.4 mg/dl, potassium 2.8 mmol/l, calcium 9.5 mg/dl, phosphorus 2.5 mg/dl, uric acid 1.5 mg/dl, normoglycaemic glycosuria and metabolic acidemia (pH 7.30, HCO3\u2212 17.4 mmol/l) (Table ). Bilateral transcervical fractures were confirmed by MRI (Fig. ) and bone scintigraphy showed multiple hot spots in her joints and ribs, compatible with osteomalacia (Fig. ). Hypophosphatemic osteomalacia was diagnosed clinically from a low serum level of phosphorus, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (11.0 pg/dl), high levels of bone specific alkaline phosphatase (67.5 IU/l), and the findings of bone scintigram, although a bone biopsy was not performed. Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) was ruled out by total body survey with whole body computed tomography or endoscopic surveillances and a normal blood FGF23 (22.1 pg/ml, 10\u201350 pg/ml) level.\nUrinalysis showed pH 6.0 and twenty four hour urine demonstrated a low renal fractional tubular reabsorption of phosphate (Tmp/GFR 0.91), increased fractional excretion of uric acid (FEUA 43.9 %) and generalized aminoaciduria.\nThe calculated anion gap was 12.4 meq/l, with an inappropriately alkaline urine (pH 6.0), suggestive of distal type of renal tubular acidosis (RTA). An intravenous bicarbonate loading test to assess the tubular dysfunction demonstrated that the increased fractional excretion of bicarbonate (FEHCO3\u2212 13.25 %) and urine-blood (UB) Pco2 gradient (U-Bpco2 50.1 mmHg), suggesting the presence of proximal type of RTA. NH4Cl loading test was not performed because of the presence of apparent metabolic acidemia. These biochemical data of blood and urine indicated Fanconi syndrome with proximal type of RTA. Tests for anti-SSA and anti-SSB were negative and serum angiotensin converting enzyme levels were normal. Furthermore, serum and urine immunoelectrophoresis revealed no monoclonal component. Any of the patient\u2019s medication did not seem to be related to Fanconi syndrome. Light microscopic examination of a kidney biopsy demonstrated cellular infiltration of interstitium and proximal tubular epithelium composed mainly of CD3+ lymphocytes without glomerular involvement, consistent with features of TIN (Fig. ,).\nThe patient was also suspected to be diagnosed as PBC because of high levels of alkaline phosphatase (663 IU/l), high serum IgM levels (1084 mg/dl) and the presence of anti-mitochondrial M2 antibody (1:10). Sequential liver biopsy demonstrated the presence of a periportal cellular infiltrate (Fig. ), compatible with PBC though biochemical liver function was normal. The combination of these findings led to the patient\u2019s diagnosis of osteomalacia caused by TIN with Fanconi syndrome in asymptomatic PBC.\nThe patient was started on therapy with calcitriol (1 \u03bcg/day), neutral potassium phosphate and sodium bicarbonate (6 g/day). She was subsequently administered middle-dose corticosteroid (20 mg/day of predonisolone) and ursodeoxycholic acid (300 mg/day).

The patient presented with intermittent abdominal distension, which was slightly under no obvious inducement, with no fever, emesis, nausea, or vomiting. Physical examination found no signs of abdominal tenderness and rebound tenderness, and liver and spleen were impalpable.\nLaboratory examination results were as follows: blood routine examination (hemoglobin 132 g/L, red blood cell count 4.61 \u00d7 10 12/L, white blood cell count 10.04 \u00d7 10 9/L, blood platelet count 180 \u00d7 10 12/L), liver enzymes (ALT 10.0 U/L, AST 17.0 U/L, GGT 16.0 U/L, ALP 86.0 U/L, TBIL 12.7 \u03bcmol/L) and renal function (BUN 5.65 mmol/L, SCr 42.0 \u03bcmol/L). Serum tumor markers AFP, CA19-9, CEA, and CA125 were all within normal limits.\nHer past medical history included hemangioma for 20 years, and asthma for 30 years, and she underwent hysteromyomectomy 8 years ago. She did not smoke or drink. The splenic ultrasound revealed multiple hypoechogenic foci measuring 5 to 38 mm in diameter. The contrast-enhanced CT showed multiple space-occupying lesions in the spleen, mottled low-density lesions, multiple hypoattenuating nodules with no contrast enhancement on the arterious phase. Delayed contrast-enhanced helical CT scan displayed incomplete filling of hypodense splenic lesions. Imaging findings raised the suspicion of a vascular neoplasm of the spleen (Fig. A and B).\nGiven that it was uncertain whether it was a benign or a malignant tumor of the spleen, a laparoscopic total splenectomy was performed for the purpose of diagnosis and treatment and informed written consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

Based on previous experience with hemolytic patients following MVR and useless of aggressive conservative therapy, we decided to do reoperation for intracardiac inspection and mitral valve replacement after a detailed communication with the patient, despite RF. During the intraoperative inspection, there was no ring dehiscence or suture-related tear of the valve tissue. The annuloplasty ring was well endothelialized. Chordal attachments were intact. However, the new artificial chordae tendinae was completely non-endothelialized (Fig. ). The plasty ring was excised and the mitral valve was replaced with a 27-mm bileaflet prosthesis (Edwards Lifesciences). The hemolytic anemia resolved gradually after the reoperation. But the RF persisted after surgery and the patient was transferred to the department of hematology for hemodialysis. Three months later, the LDH level gradually fell to 224 U/L. His hemoglobin level was stable at 95 g/dL with 3% reticulocytes. Serum creatinine level was 80.4 \u03bcmol/L.", "Question": "Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2?", "LLM Answer": "31.5", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "83.072", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.\nThe patient is 74 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0.\nThe concentration of Serum Creatinine is 80.4 \u00b5mol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Serum Creatinine from \u00b5mol to mg. The mass of Serum Creatinine is 80.4 \u00b5mol. To convert 80.4 \u00b5mol of Serum Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 80.4 \u00b5mol Serum Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/\u00b5mol = 8.04e-05 mol Serum Creatinine. To convert from mol Serum Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 8.04e-05 mol Serum Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.009 g Serum Creatinine. To convert 0.009 g of Serum Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.009 g Serum Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 9.0 mg Serum Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 9.0 mg Serum Creatinine/10.0 dL = 0.9 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 80.4 \u00b5mol Serum Creatinine/L converts to 0.9 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. Because the patient's gender is male and the creatinine concentration is less than or equal to 0.9 mg/dL, A = 0.7 and B = -0.302.\nPlugging in these values, we get 142 * (0.9/0.7)**-0.302 * 0.9938**74 * 1.0 = 83.072.\nHence, the GFR value is 83.072 ml/min/1.73 m\u00b2.", "Result": "Incorrect"}

Prior to this, the patient had had a 6-month history of lower urinary tract symptoms for which his primary medical doctor had prescribed an \u03b11 receptor antagonist at a dose of 0.4 mg orally once daily. This initially brought about brief mild improvement in the patient\u2019s symptoms, but ultimately there was an increase in lower urinary tract symptoms. The patient denied renal colic, flank pain, or any constitutional symptoms. He had not suffered any recurrent urinary tract infections in the past and denied taking any anticoagulants other than two aspirin occasionally for headache.\nOn presentation to the urology clinic, the patient was found to have severe obstructive urinary symptoms. Rectal examination revealed a grossly abnormal prostate gland with nodularity throughout the entire palpable surface. Laboratory information showed a prostate serum antigen of 20.2 ng/mL. His most recently documented prostate serum antigen was 8.5 ng/mL, which was from one year previously. Baseline blood urea nitrogen/creatinine was 32/0.87. Because the patient had obstructive symptoms and a post void residual of 319 mL, a Foley catheter was placed and he was scheduled for a cystoscopy (as part of the hematuria workup)/voiding trial. He was also put on silodosin 8 mg per day orally and ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days. Upon the patient\u2019s return to the office, his Foley catheter was draining adequately. Post void residual was 600 mL. Cystoscopy showed a large amount of clot in the base of the bladder, which was irrigated to clear, and no active bleeding was noted. Significant distortion and posterior impingement of the trigone was noted, left hemitrigone being greater than the right. No diverticulum or stones were noted. Prostatic urethra showed a near visually obstructing prostate but no intraluminal filling defects of the bladder. A computed tomography (CT) urogram showed left hydronephrosis down to the trigone and some mild nonspecific adenopathy. Urine culture and sensitivity was positive for a Proteus urinary tract infection. The patient was already on ciprofloxacin (which was shown to be sensitive) and responding to treatment. Bicalutamide 50 mg orally once daily and finasteride 5 mg orally once daily were prescribed.\nThe patient underwent transrectal ultrasound and sampling of the prostate gland. It was noted that the patient\u2019s prostatic volume was 14.6 cc. Due to the patient\u2019s age, gross hematuria, and comorbid conditions, a limited six-core prostate biopsy was performed. Biopsy showed six of six cores positive for an adenocarcinoma Gleason grade 9 (5+4) prostate cancer (see ). CT scan and bone scan did not show any evidence of metastatic spread. The patient was diagnosed with clinical stage T2cN0M0 prostate cancer. The patient completed and passed a voiding trial. Bicalutamide, silodosin, and finasteride were continued. A depot suspension of leuprolide acetate (30 mg intramuscularly every four months) was started. Calcium and vitamin D were added for additional support (entirely prophylactic, given that the patient had no vitamin deficits prior to starting leuprolide). At this stage in the patient\u2019s clinical course, his urinalysis was normal and his post void residual was down to 67 mL. The patient was counseled on the management options and chose intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) as treatment for his prostate cancer.\nFiduciary gold seed markers were placed. The patient underwent a planning CT scan which was fused with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The prostate and seminal vesicles were contoured with a planning CT scan, expanded into planning target volumes, and a radiation plan was developed. The patient received 46 treatments over 64 days for a total dose of 8,280 cGy. Phase 1 (planning target volume 1) consisted of the prostate, seminal vesicles, and regional lymph nodes receiving 4,500 cGy in 180 cGy daily fractions. Phase 2 (planning target volume 2) consisted of the prostate alone receiving 3,780 cGy in 180 cGy daily doses. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy using an image-guided linear accelerator (Varian Instruments Inc, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was utilized to minimize both acute side effects and long-term sequelae. The patient tolerated his treatments well. Mild urinary symptoms were experienced, but his urination had been improving and his international prostate symptom score was <15 (9). Therefore, the patient did not require any additional medications and we felt that any surgical intervention (such as transurethral resection of the prostate) for symptomatic relief was not warranted at this time. The patient did develop some bowel symptoms that required a change in diet.\nThe patient was examined by his urologist post radiation therapy and was clinically doing well. He had a post void residual of 104 mL and a significantly reduced prostate serum antigen of 0.4 ng/mL. Repeat renal and bladder ultrasound showed resolution of his previously noted left hydronephrosis. However, just after intensity-modulated radiation therapy ended, the patient began to experience right lower extremity weakness and intermittent numbness from the mid calf distally. The patient had not experienced any falls or trauma. His serum glucose was under control throughout his entire evaluation (prior to treatment it was noted to be 122 mg/dL and then post treatment measured 88 mg/dL). This progressed to require an evaluation by a neurologist. Physical examination showed a mild wide-based stance with decreased stride length and a tendency to circumduct the right lower extremity, with mild to moderate right foot-drop. Initial evaluation included a lumbar puncture, comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood count, urinalysis, positron emission tomography scan, renal ultrasound, and CT scans of the head and spine. All initial studies were negative. Further evaluation included an electromyogram, as well as an MRI scan of the brain/cervical and thoracic spines. MRI of the brain specifically showed only mild diffuse cortical atrophy. The cervical and thoracic spine MRI scans showed a T2 hyperintensity spanning the lateral cortical spinal tracts of the entire cervical and thoracic cords.\nBlood work was collected locally, sent to the Mayo Clinic, and profiled in their paraneoplastic autoantibody evaluation. The profile was consistent with organ-specific neurologic autoimmunity, which suggested an association with multifocal neurologic mainfestations. Specifically, the blood work revealed a positive neuronal voltage-gated potassium channel antibody. These findings combined with MRI of the spine led the neurologist to diagnose the patient with a paraneoplastic syndrome. Magnetic resonance neurography was not done. The patient\u2019s nerve pain was based solely on his personal perspective. The patient was given an ankle-foot orthosis and a cane for ambulation, was started on intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, and referred for home-based physical therapy. At this time, the patient felt that both his strength and ambulation had improved, and his physical therapist agreed.

She had off and on constitutional symptoms of disease such as general malaise, myalgia, polyarthralgia (mainly involved knee, elbow, and ankle joints), anorexia, weight loss, headache, and pyrexia from the last 4 years. She also had a history of recurrent blood-stained nasal discharge, epistaxis, nasal crusting, nasal ulceration, cough, breathlessness, stridor, and wheeze from the last 3 years. She had a history of pedal edema 3 months back. She also complained of diminution of vision with redness of eyes from 3 months. The patient had a history of ulcers on lips and tongue from the past 4 days and decreased frequency of urination from 3 days. There is no history of hematuria, hemoptysis, or cardiovascular manifestations. On examination, her vitals were deranged; she had tachycardia (120/bpm) and hypotension (100/60 mm of Hg). She also had pallor and bilateral pedal edema. There was high suspicion of GPA with acute renal failure or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis associated with systemic small-vessel vasculitis. Keeping these two main diagnoses in mind, the investigations were ordered accordingly.\nIt is based on a combination of clinical manifestations of systemic disease, positive ANCA serology, and histological evidence of necrotizing vasculitis, necrotizing glomerulonephritis, or granulomatous inflammation of affected organs such as skin, lung, or kidney.\nA trucut biopsy was taken from the right kidney of the patient and detailed analysis was done. On light microscopy, there was focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis involving more than 60% glomeruli associated with extracapillary proliferation with pauci-immune crescent formation. Electron microscopic examination showed fibrinoid deposition in the glomerular basement membrane. In biochemistry, serum sodium (159 mmol/L) and serum potassium levels (17 mmol/L) were deranged. In kidney panel, serum urea (155.8 mg/dL) and serum creatinine levels (8.9 mg/dL) were highly increased suggesting severe form of disease.\nOn performing ANCA serology, her serum showed a predominantly diffuse, granular cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) staining pattern on indirect immunofluorescence. By direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, there were high titers of ANCA directed against proteinase-3 (PR-3). PR-3 (1:100 with 1+ intensity) was highly raised and confirmed the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis associated with c-ANCA positivity.\nThe patient underwent two sessions of hemodialysis with a 2-day interval with packed red cell transfusion. Following that, serum urea and creatinine levels were controlled. Due to high levels of circulating c-ANCA autoantibodies, TPE was planned in addition to the standard therapy. GPA comes under category I, Grade 1A; American Society for Apheresis guidelines 2016.[] TPE sessions were started on the 4thday of admission. A total of seven cycles was performed with 1.3 total plasma volumes exchanged on every alternate day. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and normal saline were used as replacement fluids. During the third cycle of TPE after 5 units of FFP transfusion, the patient developed allergic reaction in the form of severe itching all over the body. To treat allergic reaction, oral pheniramine maleate 5 mg and injection hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenous (i.v.) were given, and after 20 min, procedure was restarted and completed successfully. Rest six cycles of TPE was done uneventfully. Simultaneously, standard induction therapy was also started that comprised of combination of cyclophosphamide (500 mg, i.v.) and methylprednisolone 1000 mg, i.v. daily for 3 days followed by oral prednisolone 60 mg daily for at least 4 weeks. Mesna 200 mg slow i.v. over 2 h was also given to prevent cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Regular monitoring of full blood count, serum proteins, renal function, liver function, urine cytology, and clinical symptoms were done. After seven cycles of TPE, the patient was improved clinically as indicated by her renal function tests and ANCA serology and hence TPE was stopped.

The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.\nThe patient is 70 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0.\nThe concentration of Serum Creatinine is 134.0 \u00b5mol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Serum Creatinine from \u00b5mol to mg. The mass of Serum Creatinine is 134.0 \u00b5mol. To convert 134.0 \u00b5mol of Serum Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 134.0 \u00b5mol Serum Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/\u00b5mol = 0.000134 mol Serum Creatinine. To convert from mol Serum Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.000134 mol Serum Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.015 g Serum Creatinine. To convert 0.015 g of Serum Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.015 g Serum Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 15.0 mg Serum Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 15.0 mg Serum Creatinine/10.0 dL = 1.5 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 134.0 \u00b5mol Serum Creatinine/L converts to 1.5 mg Serum Creatinine/dL.

In 2007, he noticed a gradually progressive hearing loss and repeated bloody nasal discharge resulting from a refractory sinusitis. He was admitted to our hospital for evaluation in June 2008.\nInitial laboratory findings revealed elevated serine proteinase 3-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (PR3-ANCA; 26.2 EU), blood urea nitrogen (35 mg/dl), and serum creatinine (1.62 mg/dl) levels. Urinalysis indicated proteinuria (0.2 g/day) without hematuria. A head CT revealed maxillary sinusitis. Tissue from a nasal mucosal biopsy showed granulomatous inflammation in the extravascular area. Because of these combined findings, he was diagnosed as having granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) according to the American College of Rheumatology 1990 Criteria for GPA and Watts\u2019 algorithm [, ]. The Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score 2003 was 6. Because of the low disease activity, the slow progression and the advanced age, we did not initiate immunosuppressive therapy at this time.\nIn October 2008, he developed fever lasting for several days. Laboratory data were as follows: C-reactive protein 11.91 mg/dl, PR3-ANCA 49.1 U/ml, fibrinogen 752 mg/dl, D-dimer 1.7 \u00b5g/ml, and urinary protein 0.27 g/day. Activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time and fibrin degradation product were within the respective normal range. A chest CT was normal. Although we administered meropenem (2.0 g/day for 1 week), vancomycin (500 mg/day for 17 days) and itraconazole (200 mg/day for 20 days), the fever and C-reactive protein level did not decrease. On day 12 of admission, he showed mild disorientation, severe hearing loss and hoarseness. A brain MRI revealed a mass lesion in the right frontal lobe and hypertrophic mucosa in the paranasal sinuses (fig. ) in addition to a thickened and strongly enhanced dura mater surrounding the mass lesion (fig. ). He was diagnosed as having GPA with central nervous system (CNS) involvement. The Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score had increased to 21. We treated him with methylprednisolone 500 mg daily for 3 days. However, he rapidly developed left hemiparesis and deterioration of consciousness [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS): E1V2M4]. A brain CT revealed that the parenchymal mass lesion had enlarged and the mucous effusion was invading the posterior wall of the right frontal sinus. Due to an impending transtentorial herniation, a decompressive hemicraniectomy and partial right frontal lobectomy were performed, which moderately improved his consciousness (GCS: E2V3M4). After the surgery, he developed bloody sputa, and a chest CT revealed an infiltrative shadow in both lungs.

Podocyturia was performed as described previously []. Briefly, the podocyte count was assessed by counting in urinary smears the number of cells in 10 microscopy fields of \u00d720. The podocyte count was 2.1 cells per \u00d720 field and the number of podocytes per gram of urinary creatinine was 166 (). Podocytes were identified by tagging synaptopodin (ab109560 Alexa Fluor\u00ae, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), an specific marker of podocytes, to establish their identity by immunofluorescence techniques using a secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488, Abcam, Cambridge, Uk).

Her history was notable for a background history of congenital biliary atresia (BA). She had undergone an early Kasai portoenterostomy with Roux-en-Y anastomosis in the early neonatal period. Her subsequent postoperative course was complicated by two episodes of cholangitis. By the age of two she had developed portal hypertension resulting in secondary thrombocytopenia due to hypersplenism. She had developed esophageal varices requiring annual sclerotherapy until the age of sixteen when she underwent variceal banding. Her vaccinations were up-to-date.\nGeneral findings on presentation at 11 weeks revealed icterus with scattered spider naevi. On abdominal inspection there was an upper abdominal scar from her prior surgery and on palpation the spleen was enlarged extending to below the level of the umbilicus; there was no evidence of ascites.\nAn ultrasound confirmed her estimated date of delivery. She was referred to the medical clinic at the hospital to provide a multidisciplinary team input to her care.\nAt sixteen weeks she developed an episode of cholangitis and she was treated with intravenous antibiotics for seven days. A liver ultrasound was performed. This revealed absence of intrahepatic dilatation with multiple periportal and peripancreatic varices and 14 cm splenomegaly. During the pregnancy her platelets remained low (29\u201355 \u00d7 109 L) and hemoglobin ranged from 8.8 to 10.5 g/dL. Her transaminases were marginally elevated (AST/ALT, 46/67) and coagulation parameters were normal. Significant concern remained about her thrombocytopenia and degree of hypersplenism.\nA multidisciplinary meeting was convened with hepatology, hepatobiliary surgery, and interventional radiology. Concerns for this patient included her significant splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia, risk of recurrent cholangitis, potential for massive variceal hemorrhage, and potential for preterm delivery, either spontaneous or iatrogenic. Abdominal delivery would also be compromised by large venous anastomoses in the anterior abdominal wall. A plan for management of gastrointestinal hemorrhage was outlined. Further imaging of her portal vessels was recommended as this would inform the interventional radiologists as to which was the optimum surgical intervention should bleeding develop from intraabdominal varices. The option of a splenectomy in pregnancy was excluded as this was deemed likely to cause portal vein thrombosis and would compromise any future candidacy for liver transplantation. At twenty weeks she underwent MR venography of the portal vessels. Her spleen measured 23 cm, there was evidence of extensive splenic and esophageal varices, and no lienorenal shunt was identified.\nShe had bimonthly antenatal visits with her obstetrical and hepatology teams. Her anatomy scan was within normal limits with a well-grown fetus on the 31st centile. Due to the complexity of the case and the potential for preterm delivery she received two doses of betamethasone at twenty-six weeks of gestation to aid lung maturation.\nAt 26+3 she presented to the maternity hospital with vaginal bleeding, suprapubic pressure, and uterine contractions for 24 hours with increasing intensity and duration. The fundal height was consistent with 26 weeks of pregnancy and cardiotocography was reassuring. Sterile speculum examination confirmed that the cervix was 5 cm dilated and fully effaced and the amniotic membranes were bulging through the cervix. A bedside ultrasound scan confirmed a breech presentation. Her platelet count was 33 \u00d7 109/L. Following consultation with perioperative medicine, the hepatobiliary team, and neonatology the decision was made to perform an emergency caesarean section. It had been planned to perform her surgery in a general hospital; however, due to the acute nature of her presentation the caesarean section was undertaken in the obstetric facility, with hepatobiliary surgery and interventional radiology on standby in the general hospital. Pooled platelets were administered immediately prior to surgery. Magnesium sulphate was administered to provide fetal neuroprotection. The caesarean section was performed via a vertical subumbilical incision, with a lower segment transverse incision on the uterus. The vertical incision was utilized both to provide greater access to the abdominal cavity should bleeding occur, either from the uterus or the varices, and to avoid large venous collaterals running vertically in the abdominal wall. A live male baby was delivered by breech extraction and transferred to the pediatric team following delayed cord clamping of 45 seconds. Apgar's scores were 61, 65, and 710; the cord blood gases were pH 7.27 (arterial) 7.29 (venous). The infant weighed 890 grams. The remainder of the surgery was uneventful. Perioperatively she received a further pooled platelet transfusion with good hemostasis and no transfusion of packed red cells was required. Her baby was transferred to intensive care and initially required CPAP. He had an uncomplicated neonatal course. Histology of the placenta was unremarkable. The patient had an uneventful postpartum course. She was advised against further pregnancies in view of her significant risks and underwent insertion of a levonorgestrel coil at three months postpartum for contraceptive purposes and she is currently awaiting liver transplantation.

During the transport, the cardiocirculatory parameters were relatively stable with a systolic pressure around 100 mmHg. The capnometry after return of spontaneous circulation measured a pCO2 of 60 mmHg. Upon arrival at the hospital, the physical examination showed jugular vein distension but no peripheral oedema.\nEchocardiography performed in the emergency department revealed a pericardial tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis via the subxiphoidal route, 800 mL of blood were initially evacuated. The differential diagnosis included primary respiratory failure or a sudden cardiac death with secondary pericardial effusion induced by cardiac compressions under double antiplatelet therapy, a ruptured aortic aneurysm, a myocardial rupture, or a primary laceration of a cardiac structure by the LAA occluder. A ruptured aneurysm of the ascending aorta was excluded by ultrasound. Electrocardiogram examination did not demonstrate any ST-segment elevation or low voltage. Blood gas analysis documented a stable respiratory situation with a pO2 of 230 mmHg and a pCO2 of 55 mmHg, the pH was 7, 3 and Lactate elevated with 10 mmol/L (<2 mmol/L). The haemoglobin was measured at 9 g/dL (12\u201316 g/dL). The chest X-ray demonstrated the proper placement of the endotracheal and pericardial tube and ruled out a pneumothorax or pulmonary oedema.\nIn the hours following pericardiocentesis, approximately 2 L of blood were evacuated. Conventional methods of coagulopathy management including application of tranexamic acid, fresh frozen plasma, and fibrinogen did not stop the bleeding. To stabilize the patient a total of eight packs of red blood cells were transfused.\nIn preparation of cardiac surgery, a coronary angiogram was performed (). It revealed active leakage of contrast agent in the proximal circumflex artery and the patient was transferred to the cardiac surgery department immediately. Intra-operatively a perforation of the tissue at the basis of the LAA close to the left main coronary artery was discovered. Under protection of cold blood cardioplegia on cardiopulmonary bypass the occluder was excised through the opened left atrium. The LAA was closed by endocardial sutures and two pledget sutures were used to seal the epicardial lesion at the LAA basis which stopped the bleeding.

He had truncal obesity, a \"moon face\" and proximal muscle weakness. An electrocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy. His laboratory work-up revealed anaemia (Hb 10.7 g/dl), hypokaliemia (3.4 mEq/L), metabolic alkalosis (HCO3- 35 mmol/L) and hyperglycaemia (170 mg/dl). A CT scan of thorax and abdomen demonstrated a dissection starting just below left succlavian artery and extending downward to the left renal artery, involving the celiac tripod and superior mesenteric artery (). The dissection was classified as Stanford B, De Bakey III. Moreover CT scan of abdomen revealed incidentally a left adrenal tumour of 25 mm of diameter.\nThe patient was pharmacologically treated and was felt at risk for impending aortic rupture. Therefore, an emergent endograft positioning was planned. Our goal was to exclude the damaged segment of the aorta and to obliterate the entry of blood into the false lumen (both at the initial intimal tear and at the secondary tears along the vessel). Through an inguinal incision, the right common, superficial and profunda femoral artery were dissected free. A prosthetic graft (Valiant, Medtronic, Sunnyvale, CA, USA 42 mm x 198 mm) was placed just below the origin of the left succlavian artery up to the diaphragmatic hiatus.

The patient had a medical history of well-controlled diabetes mellitus and hypertension that was being treated with an angiotensin receptor blocker, a calcium channel blocker, and a beta blocker. The body mass index was 33.8, but he had no respiratory symptoms, including sleep apnea. A preoperative chest X-ray showed mild cardiomegaly but electrocardiography and echocardiogram findings were normal. The patient's symptoms were amnesia, gait disturbance, and urinary incontinence that had persisted for 5 months; preoperatively, he was alert and cooperative and had no problem communicating. The preoperative vital signs were: blood pressure, 110/70 mmHg; heart rate, 59 beats/min; respiratory rate, 18 breaths/min; and oxygen saturation, 96%. Since the appearance of the patient suggested a possible difficult intubation, a video laryngoscope was used for tracheal intubation after induction of general anesthesia with 150 mg propofol 1%, 40 mg lidocaine 2%, and 60 mg rocuronium. The vocal cord was clearly visible on the video laryngoscope and the intubation was accomplished without trauma or other difficulties. Anesthesia was maintained with 5% desflurane and 0.02 \u00b5g/kg/min remifentanil, and air with 50% oxygen. The surgery lasted 2 hours and required no additional muscle relaxants. During the surgery, there was sudden and sustained hypotension (mean blood pressure 52\u201357 mmHg) with bradycardia (heart rate 45\u201355 beats/min) that did not respond well to ephedrine; these complications began about 10 min after the beginning of the surgery and lasted for 25 min until a dopamine infusion was administered that restored normal blood pressure. Remifentanil infusion was discontinued at the onset of hypotension and bradycardia. After the purge of volatile agents at the end of the surgery, the train of four (TOF) count was 4, and the ratio was 50%, so 2 mg/kg of sugammadex was injected. The patient recovered muscle power within a few minutes, showing firm hand grip, head elevation, and mouth opening, and was fully obeying verbal commands, but was not opening his eyes. As he was alert and cooperative at that point and no other neurologic deficit was observed, the neurosurgeons thought that the inability to open his eyes was not related to the surgery. We relieved the bandage on the head in order to reduce the chance of unintended pressure or tension on the forehead, and suggested that further neurologic examinations be done after full recovery from anesthesia. Spontaneous respiration was present, showing expired tidal volumes reaching 500 ml each time, but was tachypneic; the patient's respiratory rate ranged from 40 to 50 breaths/min. This condition continued for 5 min, at which time the patient was extubated and transferred to the PACU under mask ventilation. The patient showed signs of inspiratory stridor, chest retractions, and hoarse voice after the extubation. The patient's accessory respiratory muscles were not involved in the hyperventilation. There was no crackle or wheezing clear on auscultation besides the inspiratory stridor, but the findings were not clear on account of the hoarse voice and the rapid and dynamic ventilation. An additional 2 mg/kg of sugammadex was injected in the PACU under the theory that the patient's upper airway was obstructed because of possible residual paralysis but the condition did not change. The patient was fully responsive to verbal commands but was still unable to open his eyes or hold his breath and he complained of feeling like he was choking despite the hyperventilation. Arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) at that point showed: pH, 7.35; pCO2, 37 mmHg; pO2, 76 mmHg; HCO3, 20.4 mmol/L; and O2 saturation, 94%. The vital signs at that point were: blood pressure, 150/90 mmHg; heart rate, 110 beats/min; and respiratory rate, 44 breaths/min. Since tachypnea (40\u201350 breaths/min) persisted for 20 min in the PACU and oxygen saturation started to drop under 95%, 200 mg thiopental sodium and 100 mg succinylcholine were injected and endotracheal intubation was performed. Endotracheal suction was done immediately after intubation and there was no sputum or discharge. Auscultation right after the re-intubation sounded smooth, without crackle or wheezing, and the oxygen saturation rapidly corrected to 100%. Tachypnea persisted even under sedation after the succinylcholine wore off, so a central cause was suspected. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a massive pneumocephalus with pneumoventricle and hydrocephalus (). A chest X-ray taken after the brain CT showed no pathologic findings such as pulmonary edema, congestion, or pneumothorax. On the neurosurgeon's recommendation, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and was kept there for three days under mechanical ventilation with sedation with midazolam, cisatracurium, and rocuronium until the pneumocephalus and tachypnea spontaneously resolved. Follow-up chest radiographs were taken over the next 3 weeks and showed nothing abnormal. According to a pulmonology consultation, the tachypnea was not likely to have originated from pulmonary problems. ABGA results stayed within normal limits under fully controlled mechanical ventilation but showed hypoxemia when the patient gained spontaneous respiration during the sedative period before the resolution of the pneumocephalus. Since the follow-up chest X-rays showed no abnormal findings, pulmonary embolism evaluation including embolism CT and laboratory examinations, which also showed nothing abnormal, were done on the recommendation of a pulmonologist. When a follow-up brain CT showed resolution of the pneumocephalus on the 3rd day after the surgery, sedative and neuromuscular blocking agents were discontinued and the mechanical ventilation mode was switched to synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation. The respiratory rate at that point ranged from 15 to 20 breaths/min and ABGA results remained normal when the patient gained consciousness and self-respiration, so the endotracheal tube was extubated. The patient is now (30 days post-operation) in the general ward; he is mentally alert and has stable vital signs but still is unable to open his eyes because of bilateral ptosis and is receiving conservative treatment.", "Question": "What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?", "LLM Answer": "1", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "2", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The current CHA2DS2-VASc score is 0.\nThe patient is 59.0 years old.

He had a prior history of cerebral infarctions (x3) at the age of 66, 74 and 75 years, with a first instance of swallowing difficulties after the third stroke. At that time, dysphasia rehabilitation was initiated within 3 days of the stroke, and he recovered the ability to eat a regular meal within 2 weeks. In January 2018, 1-year after his last stroke, he underwent surgery for spinal stenosis, followed by a 10-day period of bedrest. His physical activity level subsequently declined due to back pain, and he lost 10 kg within the 10 months after surgery. Swallowing difficulties re-emerged in September 2018, with the patient only able to tolerate soft meals. His dysphasia worsened, with an increase in sputum and development of a chronic cough.\nHis medical history included cerebral infarctions (x3), diabetes mellitus, spinal stenosis, and hypertension. His height was 168.8 cm, with a body weight of 56.5 kg. He had a right hemiplegia, with the following functional measures: grip strength, 25 kg; gait speed, 0.7 m/s, assessed using the 5-m walk test; and skeletal mass index, 6.6 kg/m2. His score of 5 points on the Mini Nutritional Assessment Short Form was indicative of malnourishment. Absence of another cerebral infarct was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. Video-endoscopic swallowing assessment showed saliva pooling in the pharynx, widening of the pharyngeal space, vallecular and pyriform sinus residue, and aspiration (A). Video-fluorography revealed a decrease in the forward movement of the larynx, a widened pharyngeal space, weakened pharyngeal constriction, vallecular and pyriform sinus residue, and aspiration (A\u2013C). Functional swallowing scores were as follows: Hyodo score, 9; Fujishima grade, 6; FILS, 8; and dysphasia severity scale, 4. A probable diagnosis of sarcopenic dysphagia was made, based on the criteria defined by Mori et al. [] Clinical management included swallowing training, a high-protein diet, and nutritional guidance. The patient declined additional rehabilitation, due to his previous experience post-stroke. Therefore, we presented laryngeal suspension as a possible alternative treatment, which was performed in December 2018.\nLaryngeal suspension was performed via a minimally invasive thyromadibulopexy, using two skin incisions: one (2-cm) incision at the level of the mandible and the other (3-cm) between the hyoid bone and the superior border of the thyroid cartilage (A). Identified the white line, divided aside the anterior cervical muscles, and exposed the thyroid cartilage. Also the mandible was exposed. Two holes in the mandibular and six holes in the thyroid cartilage was made by using drill. The thyroid cartilage was fixed to the mandible using No. 2 nylon. No. 2 nylon thread was passed through the Gore-tex sheet cut to the size of thyroid cartilage. And it was passed through the thyroid cartilage, subcutaneous tunnel on the hyoid bone, mandible, subcutaneous tunnel on the hyoid bone, and tied to the other side of the nylon. As the two holes of the middle of the thyroid cartilage, two No. 2 nylons was crossed to fix the thyroid cartilage and mandible. The larynx was suspended about one vertebral body by totally using five No. 2 nylons (B), confirmed by X-ray fluoroscopy. A 1-cm incision was performed for tracheotomy, and cuffed tracheal cannula was inserted for airway management.\nMaintaining some neck flexion for a period of 1-week was conducted. Nutritional support was initiated via gastrostomy tube feeding. The cuffed tracheal cannula was changed to an uncuffed cannula on postoperative day (POD) 1. The wound was stable and there was no pain. Swallowing was initiated using jelly and cold tea, with the patient in a flat lateral position. The tracheal cannula was removed on POD 4. Video-fluorography revealed contrast agent residue in the vallecular but with a decrease in residue in the pyriform sinus compared to pre-operative measures, with no evidence of aspiration on POD 6 (A\u2013C). Anterosuperior movement of the larynx was improved, reaching one vertebral level higher than before surgery. The swallowing reflex was maintained, with sufficient opening of the esophageal orifice, avoiding the need for mandibular protrusion to swallow. Swallowing using modified food was initiated in a sitting position on POD 6 and the gastrostomy tube was removed on POD 7. Video-endoscopic examination confirmed his ability to eat a rice cracker and noodles without aspiration and no evidence of pharyngeal residue on POD 11 (B). The patient was able to eat soft meals on POD 14, and a regular meal on POD 18, and was discharged on POD 21. The patient gained 2 kg in the 2 months after surgery, with improvement in functional scores: Hyodo score, 5; Fujishima grade, 8; FILS, 8; and dysphasia severity scale, 6. There was no exacerbation of the condition over a 10-month period after surgery, and the patient has a normal diet and is able to travel.

He had undergone total hip replacement for right femoral head fracture caused by a traffic accident at the age of 71, and he received a surgical procedure for lumber spinal stenosis at the age of 74. Borderline diabetes mellitus with HbA1c levels ranging from 6.0% to 6.6% was pointed out since the age of 72, while the blood glucose level remained within a normal range. At the age of 76, the diagnosis of hypertensive and diabetic chronic kidney disease was made. The patient suffered from pneumonia when he was 78 years old. One year before admission, an infected cyst (abscess) around the right femoral prosthesis was indicated by fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography. Staphylococcus aureus was cultured, and the first and third-generation Cefem plus new quinolone were continuously administered. Three months before admission, continuous drainage from the infected lesion was conducted. No gastrointestinal complaints were recorded prior to the final admission.\nHis watery diarrhea was severe, more than 10 times a day, and hematochezia was associated. The body temperature was 37.5\u00b0C, blood pressure 138/90 mm Hg, heart rate 100 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation 96% while breathing ambient air. The body weight was 57.0 kg with a body mass index at 22.0. Systolic heart murmur was auscultated. The abdomen was soft with weak bowel sounds. There was tenderness of the whole abdomen on palpation, without guarding, rigidity, distention, or mass formation. Main results of laboratory tests on admission included the following: white blood cells 4400/\u03bcL, hemoglobin 13.3 g/dL, platelets 305 000/\u03bcL, Na 135 mmol/L, K 3.6 mmol/L, Cl 102 mmol/L, Ca 6.4 mg/dL, Pi 4.6 mg/dL, albumin 1.8 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen 49.9 mg/dL, creatinine 5.3 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein 26.1 mg/dL. The electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with long PR and QT intervals. Deterioration of renal functions for the last 10-year period is illustrated in Figure . For the last 3 months, hemodialysis was needed.\nPlain and contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans, performed on the first and eighth days of hospitalization, respectively, indicated significant ischemic changes of the sigmoid colon through the rectum with wall thickening of the sigmoid colon, ascites retention, bilateral pleural effusions, and mild renal atrophy. Colonofiberscopy indicated diverticulosis in the sigmoid colon and ischemic changes and erosions of the stenotic sigmoid colon through rectum (Figure ). Microbiologically, the stool proved normal flora, and fecal Clostridium difficile toxin test and blood microbial culture were negative. The clinical diagnosis of ischemic and infectious colitis secondary to the long-term usage of antibiotics was made. Intravenous infusion of ceftriaxone for 5 days was chosen empirically because it is metabolized in the liver. However, it was ineffective for relieving diarrhea and colitis, and then meropenem was chosen for controlling the intractable colonic symptoms. Inflammation peaked out 14 days after the treatment, but soon, the inflammatory reaction and diarrhea re-exacerbated. The patient expired 26 days after admission. No free air was observed in the abdominal cavity on the contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan 3 days before death.\nThe autopsy was conducted 6 hours after death. In the sigmoid colon, fibrosing and adhesive diverticulitis with mucosal ischemic changes and erosions were grossly observed. Microscopically, eosinophilic hyaline material was deposited throughout the gut wall. The deposits were congophilic. Immunohistochemically, amyloid A, visualized by the monoclonal antibody mc-1 against serum amyloid A1 (SAA1), was identified in the lamina propria mucosae through the subserosa, including diverticular and vascular walls (Figure ). In the prepylorus of the stomach, a large perforating ulcer measuring 12 mm was found, and purulent peritonitis with turbid ascites was associated (Figure ). Candida infection was microscopically demonstrated on the involved mucosa and serosa at the site of gastric perforation (Figure ). Candida albicans were cultured from turbid ascitic fluid containing a total of 1150 mL. Candidal esophagitis was also noted. Deposition of amyloid A was evident in the gastric mucosa through the subserosa, and the amyloid deposition was especially prominent and seen in the full-thickness of the mucosa at the site of gastric perforation (Figure ). Amyloid A was also diffusely deposited in the wall of the esophagus through the rectum. Pleural effusion was associated (left: 150 mL, right: 300 mL).\nSystemic congophilic deposition of amyloid A was further demonstrated in the tongue, salivary gland, thyroid gland, lung, heart, pancreas, splenic white pulp, adrenal glands, kidney, urinary bladder, and ureter. The deposition was especially pronounced in the thyroid gland (38 g) and urinary tract.\nAtrophic kidneys weighed 72 g (left) and 73 g (right). Microscopically, amyloid A deposits caused amyloid glomerulopathy in association with vascular wall involvement. Features of diabetic glomerulosclerosis were indistinct because of marked amyloid deposition, while arteriolosclerosis was observed. Pancreatic islets focally showed diabetes-related localized hyaline (amyloid) deposition. Characteristically, co-deposition of amyloid A and IgM in the renal glomerulus was demonstrated by immunostaining using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections after prolonged protease-1 digestion (Figure ). IgG and IgA were undetectable. The co-deposition of amyloid A and IgM was scarcely observed in the systemic amyloid A deposits outside the kidney (Figure ).\nMost of the hepatocytes were immunostained with the anti-SAA1 monoclonal antibody mc-1. Cytoplasmic granular positivity was evident. The acinar cells of the pancreas and salivary gland were also positively stained. These findings indicated accelerated production of SAA1 protein by these cells as a prolonged inflammatory response (Figure ).\nAnother incidental finding included aortic stenosis caused by dystrophic calcification in the cusps of the aortic valve. Left ventricular hypertrophy (heart weight 415 g) was caused by both aortic stenosis and amyloid deposition. The aorta revealed severe atherosclerosis. The abscess lesion around the right femoral prosthesis was not evaluated.", "Question": "What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?", "LLM Answer": "100.0", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "106", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure).

Her medical history was remarkable for heterozygote alpha-thalassemia, but negative for thrombotic and recurrent infectious events. The family history was also negative for thrombotic events or bleeding tendency. The patient was not treated with anticoagulants or platelet inhibitors. Physical examination was normal (BMI 23.0 kg/m2, blood pressure 125/70 mmHg, heart rate 85/min, normal heart sounds, and no vascular murmurs). After the exclusion of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, vasculitis, hyperviscosity, and sickle cell disease, a thrombophilia workup was performed. All hemostatic laboratory parameters were found normal except for an increased protein S activity (179%) with high free protein S level (207%), despite a normal total protein S antigen level (98%) (Table ). This suggested that, in contrast to normal conditions, all protein S was free protein S, instead of 30\u201340% free and 60\u201370% bound protein S. High activity and antigen levels of free protein S were confirmed in a separate sample 3 months later. Clinically, a protein S deficiency is considered as a possible cause of hypercoagulation, which in turn could have led to the retinopathy. The incidental finding of elevated protein S levels were not considered explanatory of the condition. We did not initiate anticoagulation or thrombocyte aggregation inhibition. The patient's vision did not improve remarkably, nor did it deteriorate in the subsequent months after her initial visit.\nThe high free protein S level in the proband was caused by a reduced level of C4BP (18%), as measured with an ELISA against the \u03b1-chain of C4BP. To identify a possible molecular defect underlying the C4BP deficiency, we sequenced the protein-coding regions and exon/intron boundaries of C4BPA (encoding C4BP\u03b1, ) and C4BPB (encoding C4BP\u03b2, ).\nWe identified two previously reported non-synonymous variants in C4BPA, that is, c.719G>A (p.R240H), rs45574833 ((A=0.0140/1686 (ExAC), A = 0.0030/15 (1000 Genomes), A = 0.0095/124 (GO-ESP), A = 0.0078/227 (TOPMED)), and c.899T>C (p.I300T), rs4844573 (C = 0.4014/47780 [ExAC], C = 0.4898/2453 [1000 Genomes], C = 0.4841/6296 [GO-ESP], T = 0.4689/13653 [TOPMED]).\nIn addition, we screened the father and brother for these mutations. Both are also Surinamese. Only p.I300T was present in the father (Fig. ). Both father and brother had normal free protein S levels. Mother, second sister, and second brother were unavailable for testing.\nDiscordant data concerning the association between C4BP polymorphisms and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome have been reported , . Furthermore, these two variants have also been identified in women experiencing recurrent miscarriages, but due to equally high frequencies between patients and controls, the importance of these variants in this particular clinical situation may be questionable . No mutations were found in the C4BPB gene.\nBecause we could not find clear molecular defect in the C4BP gene responsible for the reduced expression, and a recent report indicated that binding of protein S to C4BP promotes cellular secretion of C4BP , we also sequenced the sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)-like region of protein S (), responsible for binding to C4BP using the previously published primers , . No mutations explaining a reduced binding of protein S to C4BP were found in the SHBG-domain of protein S.\nAlthough the medical records did not report any use of vitamin K antagonist, we excluded the interference of any form of vitamin K antagonists by the measurement of coagulation factors II, VII, and X which were all normal, except for factor X which was slightly increased (163%) (Table ). Furthermore, there was no indication of reduced capacity of liver synthesis with normal antithrombin and factor V levels.

Urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine. Arterial blood gas showed a pH 7.33, paCO2 68.5 and paO2 88.6 on FiO2 of 40%. Electrocardiogram confirmed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Echocardiogram revealed a myopathic severely enlarged left ventricular chamber with moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and severe global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 8 to 10%. The patient's work of breathing and oxygenation improved with Bipap. He was started on diltiazem and diuresis was initiated. The patient was admitted to the step-down unit with a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation.\nOn hospital day number eight, the overnight nurse found the patient unresponsive. A code blue was called. His initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation and he was shocked with 200 J twice before regaining pulses. When stabilised, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) where he regained consciousness and full neurologic function within one hour of the event. The following day, an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) was placed. Intraoperatively, the patient had runs of ventricular tachycardia with hypotension to 80 mmHg systolic. Postoperatively, the patient was found to have a right fixed mid-dilated pupil, flaccid paralysis of the left arm and leg with hyperreflexia throughout the left side. Computed tomography (CT) of the head revealed a right midbrain and thalamic stroke thought to be secondary to transient arrhythmia-induced hypoperfusion, intraoperatively.\nOn postoperative day number three, after AICD placement and stroke, the patient acutely developed a rigid distended board-like abdomen with dullness to percussion. Vitals at that time were temperature, 98.4 degrees Fahrenheit; blood pressure, 112/67 mmHg; heart rate range, 55 beats per minute, and respiratory rate 26 on ventilator settings of assist control volume control with a rate of 26; tidal volume, 500 ml; FiO2, 40% and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5. His peak inspiratory pressure on the ventilator had risen from 26 to 72 mmHg; his plateau had risen from 15 to 48 mmHg with oxygen desaturation from 93 to 85%.

This constellation of findings prompted the team to measure an abdominal compartment pressure which was elevated to 53 cm H2O (40 mmHg) with an abdominal perfusion pressure (APP) of 42 mmHg. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed which showed no dilated loops of bowel, no ileus, no evidence of free air, abscess or obstruction and minimal free fluid []. Pertinent labs from the event revealed a lactate of 1.0 mg/dl; lipase, 159 U/l; amylase, 76 U/l; creatinine, 1.53 mg/dl. Surgery was consulted and the FiO2 was increased to 100%, which improved his oxygen saturation to 96% despite his elevated peak inspiratory pressures.\nSurgical recommendations were for an emergent bedside surgical abdominal decompression. The patient was administered 10 mg of intravenous cisatracurium besylate by anaesthesia in preparation for surgical management. Shortly following paralytic administration, his peak inspiratory pressure corrected from 72 to 23 mmHg, his plateau pressure from 48 to 16 mmHg and his oxygenation status tolerated a decrease in FiO2 down to 40% with his oxygen saturation returning to baseline. Measurement of his abdominal compartment pressure revealed a drop from 53 (40 mmHg) to 23 cm H2O (17 mmHg) and then normalised to 15 cm H20 (11 mmHg) over a three-hour period. During this entire event, the patient averaged 100 to 200 cc/hr of urine output and laboratory values from the following day showed a drop in creatinine from 1.53 to 1.29 mg/dl. Given this correction, surgical management was postponed and the patient was monitored. The patient remained hospitalised for an additional 73 days.

He was a smoker with diabetes and chronic kidney disease Class 3a with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 48 mL/min/m2. The hospital had no coronary intervention facilities, so he received thrombolytic therapy. Two weeks later, he presented to our emergency department with typical chest pain and exertional dyspnoea (New York Heart Association Class III). He was on dual antiplatelet therapy, Bisoprolol, Atorvastatin, and Isosorbide dinitrates. There was no echocardiogram report with the patient.\nAuscultation confirmed a harsh pansystolic murmur V/VI on his left parasternal area and across the precordium. He had bilateral, fine basal crepitations. His heart rate was 88 b.p.m. and blood pressure was 115/67 mmHg.\nTransthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and transoesophageal echocardiogram (TOE) demonstrated an akinetic inferior wall and inferior septum with an ejection fraction (EF) of 45%. A large, true aneurysm in the mid-cavity inferior wall was identified by its wide neck and contracting muscle layer ( and ). The inferior septum was ruptured and dissected with a large, left-to-right shunt ( and ). A TOE X-plane transgastric short-axis view in diastole showed an inferior wall aneurysm with a wide neck of 2 cm (). The aneurysm cavity connected to the RV through the ruptured part of the inferior septum, creating an LV-to-RV-to-aneurysm communication ( and ). We noted mild tricuspid regurgitation with an estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure of 75 mmHg. RV function was mildly reduced (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion of 1.6 cm). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed non-viable inferior segments, and a 4.2 cm \u00d7 4.3 cm \u00d7 5.8 cm cavitary lesion. The LV showed a mid-inferior and inferoseptal wide-neck true aneurysm () with a focal area of ventricular septal rupture in the inferior aspect of the aneurysm with a turbulent high-velocity flow across it (). The patient\u2019s coronary angiography displayed tight proximal and middle right coronary artery lesions, as well as a severe ostial left main, a severe mid-left anterior descending artery lesion, and severe ramus intermedius disease.\nThe patient was considered high surgical risk because of his age, general condition, renal impairment, and difficult anatomy of the post-infarct VSD and aneurysm. Transcatheter closure of the post-infarct VSD and inferior wall aneurysm was performed. Because of the two different pathologies, we closed the VSD first using an antegrade approach from the venous side. Next, we closed the neck of the aneurysm using a retrograde approach from the arterial side. A Terumo guidewire (260 cm) was introduced from the right common femoral vein. The wire passed from the RV to the inferior wall aneurysm to the LV and finally to the aorta. We then exchanged the Terumo guidewire with an Amplatzer stiff guidewire (260 cm).\nWe used an 8 French Amplatzer delivery sheath to deploy an 18-mm ASO (AGA Medical Corporation, USA) to close the VSD completely (, and ). We selected the size based on TOE measurements. The RV-to-aneurysm communication measured 14 mm, so we oversized the ASO device by 4 mm to fit inside the defect. The aneurysm was engaged in retrograde from the LV using a 6 French PG catheter introduced from the right common femoral artery and over the Terumo guidewire (260 cm), which was then replaced by a Confida stiff guidewire (Medtronic) of the same length. We cannulated the inferior aneurysm mouth with a Torque-Vue 10 F/45 delivery sheath. The ASO (26 mm) device was deployed with a large disc in the aneurysm (, and ). We selected the size based on the TOE measurement. The aneurysm mouth measured 20 mm, so we increased the ASO length by 6 mm to fit inside the aneurysm. We assured enough distance between the aneurysm mouth and the mitral valve so that the deployed disc would not affect the mitral valve. Both devices were established with the aneurysm device resting on the post-infarct VSD device ( and ).\nLeft ventricular (LV) injection and TOE showed complete occlusion of the post-infarct VSD and aneurysm. Both devices established contact and showed the angulated relation of their two different planes (, and ). The akinetic inferior wal procedure and fluoroscopy times were 60 min and 25 min, respectively, and the total contrast amount was 40 mL. The patient recovered uneventfully within 6 days in the intensive care unit. As EF was 45%, we selected to do full revascularization. The patient underwent complete revascularization for his right coronary artery, left main artery, proximal left anterior descending artery, and ramus intermedius (). The patient was discharged after 14 days. At his 3-month follow-up, he remained well with reasonable exercise tolerance, NYHA Class I.

At admission her height was measured to be 139.8 cm and her weight was measured to be 46.5 kg. Her past medical history included NF, congenital pseudarthrosis, and combined deformities of the tibia and fibula that resulted in the shortening of the right lower limb. At presentation, her examination revealed a limited active range of motion at the right knee joint (from 0 to 90\u00b0), a valgus deformity of 14\u00b0 using the femoro-tibial angle measurement, severe pain, and a progressively worsening antalgic gait due to the preexisting limb shortening. These deformities, including pseudoarthrosis, are consistent with skeletal deformities previously described in patients diagnosed with NF. She was diagnosed with Grade 4 OA as per the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) classification based on the results of radiographic imaging and the physical examination (). Her walking distance was limited due to pain. Passive range of motion studies revealed significant hyperextension (\u221210\u00b0) consistent with an increased risk for dislocation. The physical exam also revealed peroneal nerve palsy and caf\u00e9 au-lait spots across her entire body, the latter finding indicative of advanced NF. She had previously undergone a bone transplant at the fibula with a graft taken from the tibia approximately 50 years prior; as such, there was only a limited amount of viable bone remaining to support the successful implantation of a prosthesis. As there was not sufficient viable bone stock available to support the ready-made intramedullary stem used in total knee arthroplasty (TKA; ), our initial plan was to perform a bicompartmental knee arthroplasty (BKA). Furthermore, as part of the preoperative procedure at our hospital, we conducted a bone density test. This evaluation revealed a femoral bone density of 0.525 g/cm3, which affirmed our decision to avoid a TKA, as the quality of the available bone stock would unlikely be sufficient to support adequate fixation of the larger implants required in this procedure. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was performed to provide maximum visualization of the lesion, given the discrepancies in the anatomical structures and also to evaluate the soft tissue condition (). Although a bicompartmental knee implant was templated, the cartilage on the medial side of the joint was found to be intact on the coronal MRI scan, thereby presenting a contraindication to this procedure (). Additional radiographic studies revealed that the patient had both femoral and tibial insufficiency and a significant reduction in the bone stock available for the positioning of an implant that required a tibial stem. As this patient also exhibited problems with osteogenesis due to NF, all procedures were planned with the goal of limiting the degree of tissue damage. With this in mind, we considered unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) as a minimally invasive procedure that might be used for the successful amelioration of her OA symptoms. A lateral UKA to fix the valgus deformity was discussed with the patient as a means to provide adequate relief from the pain resulting from the bone-on-bone contact at the lateral side as well as to address the problem of hyperextension. The patient agreed to this course of action. Preoperative planning focused on addressing the issues associated with bone-on-bone contact as well as repair of the valgus deformity with the goal of promoting stability at the knee. The range of motion was verified preoperatively, and femoral and tibial contact points were mapped across the full range of motion to determine the degree of the anterior slope. Unfortunately, the dimensions of the anterior slope precluded the use of an implant of the size that would be desirable given the patient\u2019s tibial dimensions. We were also aware of the fact that the risks of dislocation are increased in NF patients due to characteristic joint hypermobility and problems with soft tissue in areas such as the skin, menisci, and musculature.\nDuring surgery, the surrounding tissue was debrided, and a large fragment of debris was removed from the joint space. Visual inspection of the knee confirmed the diagnosis of isolated lateral OA with intact medial articulation (). A femoral unicompartmental knee system (Physica ZUK; size D) implant and a 29 mm \u00d7 50 mm tibial implant (Zimmer\u00ae) were inserted. Perioperative radiographs revealed that, although the trial implant was slightly larger than ideal, synchronous soft tissue balance of the knee was confirmed (). Unfortunately, as customized implants were not available, space remained between the femoral implant and the femoral condyle.\nPrior to final fixation, the articulation site was copiously irrigated to facilitate the penetration of cement into the femur and tibia. The final implant was then inserted into small holes that were drilled into the tibia and femur that also facilitated cement adhesion. The cement was molded to fill the gap observed during the trial implantation ().\nPostoperative imaging and physical examination revealed that the anterior tibial slope was repaired and that the valgus deformity was reduced to 5\u00b0 from the 14\u00b0 determined preoperatively (). The patient was capable of ambulation within 24 hours after completion of the procedure. However, the patient developed a varus thrust and continued to require epidural analgesia for 48 hours after the procedure. The rehabilitation plan included assisted range of motion and partial weight-bearing walking exercises. The patient exhibited a myopathic gait; this was deemed acceptable given her preexisting musculoskeletal condition. One week after the procedure, the patient continued to ambulate with the assistance of two walking poles and a knee brace. She reported that soreness developed after walking for approximately 20 meters; this was attributed to preoperative muscle stiffness (). The active range of motion extended from 0 to 110\u00b0; this represented a significant improvement over her preoperative range of 0 to 90\u00b0. Ankle movement was restricted due to preexisting peroneal nerve palsy and mild pain was present after the surgery. The most substantial functional gains from the lateral UKA procedure were the improvements in the knee alignment and the reduction in the valgus deformity. Both of these corrections contributed to significant improvements in patient ambulation.\nTwo weeks after the procedure, the patient experienced a fall that resulted in a stress fracture of the tibial plateau. The lesion was diagnosed as a proximal oblique fracture of the tibia. This was most likely due to a mismatch between the implant and patient-specific mechano-physiology which may have potentially resulted in sagittal overcutting. The tibial UKA component was not displaced (). Three days post-fracture, a surgical procedure involving a locking plate was planned. A distal tibia anterolateral plate (A.L.P.S\u00ae) with nine holes was rotated upside down to achieve successful fixation of the fracture. Eight locking cortical screws were inserted; postoperative imaging documented adequate fixation and support (). Given the high risk for dislocations, continuous passive motion therapy was contraindicated. Within five days after the second procedure, the patient reported only minimal pain and was able to undergo successful rehabilitation to improve her range of motion. We note that her participation in the standard rehabilitation program was interrupted due to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This was unfortunate, as adequate postoperative rehabilitation can be critical for recovery. The patient was provided with a fixed knee brace to stabilize her leg during the first two months after the insertion of the locking plate. As the COVID-19 pandemic was then under adequate control in the region, the patient was able to follow a rehabilitation plan that included both passive and active progressive range of motion exercises, partial weight-bearing walking regimens, and measures designed to manage pain and swelling. The patient was put on a partial weight-bearing walking regimen (30% to start, gradually increased to 100% body weight every week) beginning at one week postoperatively. At the two-month postoperative checkup, the patient was able to walk with a full weight load without assistance (). Four months after the procedure, the patient reported significant improvements with respect to pain and active range of motion. The patient returned to her activities of daily life and did not need a knee brace or supporter (). Radiographic images revealed callus formation at the fracture site, indicative of new bone formation. We planned to follow this patient on a more long-term basis to manage pain and swelling and to maintain the improved range of motion and weight-bearing capability. However, the overall impact of COVID-19 limited the extent to which we could follow this patient after the five-month check-up. Nonetheless, the patient planned to continue with the prescribed rehabilitation plan. The patient presented for a 7-month postoperative checkup and reported some residual pain that she managed effectively with the pain medication regimen that was prescribed. She reported that she was able to walk on most days and carry out day-to-day activities without difficulty. On certain days, she noted some instability at her knee joint which is likely attributable to the postoperative fracture. Further radiographic studies revealed appropriate fracture healing, and her physical exam documented appropriate knee alignment.\nAlthough the patient was capable of ambulation prior to the UKA procedure, she relied on external support and experienced substantial pain due to osteoarthritis and poor knee alignment. The contraindications to a conventional TKA outweighed the possible benefits that might be achieved in this case. A UKA seemed to be a more appropriate solution toward resolving the pain resulting from bone-on-bone contact and the valgus deformity. The UKA procedure is less invasive, maintains the kinematics at the knee, preserves more bone, and facilitates easier revision surgery if this becomes necessary.\nThe decision to perform a UKA was controversial due to the unique complexities associated with this patient. However, these therapeutic modalities resulted in a significant improvement in the patient\u2019s quality of life. This outcome was evaluated quantitatively by the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) which is included in the (). An increase of 8\u201310 points on the KOOS total score has been clearly established as a clinically significant improvement. Our patient exhibited a 23.2-point increase in KOOS in response to treatment. This finding indicates that the patient experienced significant benefit from the complete treatment plan.

The patient had suffered difficulties in walking from weakening of both lower limb muscles since 25 years ago, and recently the symptom of weakness of lower limb muscles became more serious and dyspnea at the level of ATS (American Thoracic Society) Dyspnea Grade I had occurred due to the weakening of the respiratory root. A molecular genetics examination conducted at another hospital discovered a deficit of the SMN1 gene, and considering the time of onset and clinical conditions, the patient was diagnosed with type IV spinal muscular atrophy. The patient stood 168 cm and weighed 63 kg, and there were no special opinions from ECG and simple radioactive examination before operation. Arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) showed pH 7.435, PaO2 74.6 mmHg, PaCO2 36.9 mmHg, and HCO3- 24.2 mmHg. The patient was under drug treatment for hypertension. Administration before anesthesia was not conducted and vital signs examined after going into the operating room were blood pressure: 160/100 mmHg; respiration rate per minute: 20 times; ECG: normal sinus rhythm; and pulse oxymetry: 98%. From a manual muscle test before operation, both legs were at the 4th stage. At the genupectoral position, the epidural space was identified by loss of resistance technique using an 18 G Tuohy insertion needle in between the L2-L3 lumbar, and after a test dose injection of 1.5% lidocaine 3 ml containing 1 : 200,000 epinephrine, no increase of heart rate or spinal anesthesia symptom was detected. After injecting 0.75% ropivacaine 12 ml, a catheter was placed and maintained. To measure the level of motor block by time after anesthesia, a modified Bromage scale (0: One can stretch and raise his/her leg; 1: One cannot raise his/her leg and cannot bend his/her knee; 2: One cannot his/her knee but can bend his/her ankle; 3: One cannot bend his/her ankle) was applied.\nThe level of modified Bromage scale before anesthesia was 1, and 20 minutes after injecting ropivacaine, the level of modified Bromage scale was 3. The sensory nerves were blocked by T8 segment on pinprick examination. Vital signs during operation were blood pressure: 120-140/60-80 mmHg and pulse rate per minute: stable at 70-80 times. A Venti\u00ae mask with 35% of oxygen fraction in inspired air was used, and an ETCO2 capnometer was placed under the nose of the patient to monitor the end-tidal CO2. ETCO2 was stable at 35 mmHg and the pulse oxymetry was 100%. Due to the risk of aspiration of saliva or bronchial secretion during operation, sedation was not operated. The surgery was operated for an hour, and the epidural catheter was removed after operation. After finishing the operation, the level of modified Bromage scale was 3 and the sensory nerve block was decreased up to the T9 segment. Three hours after the operation, the level of modified Bromage scale was dropped to 2 and the sensory nerve block to the T11 segment; 5 hours after the operation, the stage of modified Bromage scale was 1, and the sensory nerve was declined to the L1 segment. Since the patient did not show adverse effects including vomiting, nausea, and dizziness in the recovery room, he was moved to a patient room. Twelve hours after finishing the operation, both the level of the modified Bromage scale and sensory nerve were recovered to the condition before operation, and also for the manual muscle test, both legs were maintained at the 4th stage.

When he was being treated for pneumonia at another hospital, CT image incidentally revealed a BT and mild right-sided hydronephrosis (Fig. ) without metastasis. After his pneumonia had been cured, the patient was referred to the SIMC to receive treatment for his BT (SIMC-Uro# 11116, a unique non-sequential patient control number issued at the Department of Uro-Oncology, SIMC). At his first visit, the patient's physical (height: 1.56 m, weight: 48.9 kg) and routine laboratory data were within the normal ranges. He had been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, which required regular insulin injections. MRI showed many BTs (Figs \u2013). The largest tumor detected on MRI is indicated by the blue arrowhead in Figure a. The tumor indicated by the yellow arrowhead was observed as it progressed between the right ureteral wall (white arrowhead in Figure a) and bladder wall (red arrowhead). Moreover, a tumor was found within the right orifice of the ureter (green arrowhead), which had presumably caused the mild right-sided hydroureter (\u201cu\u201d in Figure a, see also Figures \u2013). Thus, the patient was diagnosed with bladder carcinoma, which was suspected to have infiltrated into the ureter (green arrowhead). No apparent muscle invasion, lymph node metastasis, or distant metastasis was observed (clinical classification: T1, N0, M0, according to the classification of the Union for International Cancer Control).\nThe patient underwent oral-PDD-TUR-BT (20 mg/kg of 5-ALA was administered 2 hours before surgery) using the D-LIGHT system (Table ). As suggested by MRI (blue arrowhead in Figure a), the main papillary tumor was located on the right ureteral orifice (blue arrowhead in Figure b), and it clearly emitted fluorescence under blue light (Fig. c). It had invaded the bladder neck, the prostatic urethra, and the right posterior wall of the bladder (Video ). In addition, three daughter tumors were found on the posterior wall of the bladder (Video ). Random bladder biopsy samples were obtained from the surrounding normal tissue (the posterior, left, and right walls) and the tumor-infiltrated tissue (the bladder neck and prostatic urethra). Subsequently, we deeply resected the largest tumor (Fig. b,c). The right ureteral orifice was exposed, and it was found to have been blocked by papillary tumors (the tumors in the ureter and the ureteral wall are indicated by green and white arrowheads, respectively; Fig. d,e). We deeply resected the tumors in the ureteral orifice; however, after the resection procedure residual tumors were identified within the ureteral orifice (green arrowhead in Figure f), which emitted potent fluorescence under blue light (Fig. g, see also Video ). We decided to attempt to remove the remaining tumors. After the second and third attempts to resect the ureteral tumors (deep resections, Video ), no tumors were visible under white light in the right ureter (Fig. h); however, marked fluorescence was observed from the ureteral mucosa (Fig. i), which was indicative of residual cancer. If the patient had undergone TUR without PDD, we would have finished the surgery at this point. Instead, we performed a biopsy of the fluorescence-emitting tissue. We then attempted to remove the suspected residual carcinoma. After the fourth resection of the ureteral orifice, the hydroureter-affected lumen was exposed, the mucosa of which was smooth and did not emit fluorescence (Fig. j,k). Subsequently, we performed a biopsy of the ureteral mucosa (Video ).\nThe pathological diagnosis of the BT was low-grade urothelial carcinoma, which had not invaded the muscular layer (pTa). No cancer cells were detected in random biopsy specimens. As expected from the PDD, low-grade cancer cells were detected in the ureteral mucosa after the third resection of the ureteral orifice, in which an irregular and fluorescent mucosa was identified (Fig. h,i). On the other hand, no cancer cells were found in the smooth and non-fluorescent mucosa after the fourth resection procedure. To prevent tumor recurrence, the patient is currently being treated with intravesically administered BCG via a right ureteral stent, which exposes both the ureter and the bladder to BCG. We concluded that the ureteral tumor was a BT that had infiltrated into the ureter because (i) preoperative MRI (Fig. a) showed that the main tumor was located in the bladder, (ii) the hydronephrosis was mild (CT findings, Figure ; the hydronephrosis would have been severe if the ureteral tumor had originated from the ureteral orifice), and (iii) the pathological analyses did not show muscular invasion.

She weighed 42 kg and was 137 cm in height. Treatment for asthma that had been initiated about 1 month before had not improved her respiratory condition. She presented with marked stridor and cough, severe intercostal and subcostal chest retraction, and developed acute respiratory distress. Her parents mentioned that her respiratory condition might have been worsened by an external traumatic event at the neck that had been caused by her younger brother a few months earlier. At that time, while she had been playing with her younger brother, his elbow had bumped into her neck violently.\nOn admission, computed tomography (CT) of the neck showed that severe subglottic stenosis has developed with minimal cross-sectional diameters of 3.5 \u00d7 1.8 mm at the narrowest point (0.05 cm2) (Fig. ). Laryngoscopy revealed that her airway was almost completely obstructed by severe subglottic stenosis. Findings from other preoperative investigations including laboratory tests, chest X-ray, and electrocardiography were normal. The preoperative vital signs were blood pressure of 120/59 mmHg, temperature of 37.5 \u00b0C, respiratory rate of 20/min, and SpO2 of 98% (O2 5 L/min via mask). Because the cause of the severe subglottic stenosis was unclear and her symptoms were worsening day by day, we decided to perform emergency tracheostomy to prevent further worsening of her symptoms and a life-threatening condition.\nThe case was discussed in detail among otolaryngologists and anesthesiologists. Because we anticipated intubation to be impossible, emergency tracheostomy was planned. She was transferred to the operation room for emergency tracheostomy.

Emergent tracheostomy was therefore planned under general anesthesia. Sevoflurane was administered with sufficient titration to maintain spontaneous breathing. Anesthesia was maintained via the inhalation of air, oxygen, and sevoflurane. We considered that the use of a face mask instead of supraglottic airway devices during anesthesia might minimize the risk of tracheal injury or laryngospasm. The lungs were fully preoxygenated. The sevoflurane concentration was increased to 3%, at which point the patient was unresponsive.\nThe patient initially continued breathing spontaneously, but ventilation later became impossible because the otolaryngologists pulled her trachea. Before the oxygenation and hemodynamics became unstable, tracheostomy was successfully performed by the otolaryngologists. The patient was admitted to our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for postoperative airway management.\nOn postoperative day (POD) 3, because her airway had been stabilized by tracheostomy, she was discharged from the PICU. On POD 4, CT of the neck still showed narrowing of the subglottic portion. On POD 7, a laryngoscope under general anesthesia revealed severe edema at the subglottic stenosis (Fig. ). The otolaryngologists considered that the cause of the subglottic stenosis might be edema due to cricoid fracture, given her medical history.\nAt five months after surgery, a laryngoscope was again inserted under general anesthesia, revealing large granulomas surrounding an object in the subglottic wall. Surprisingly, this object turned out to be a circular plastic foreign body (cross-sectional diameter of 1.2 \u00d7 1.0 cm) (Fig. ). Surgery was performed to remove the object. On showing the foreign body to the patient and her parents, they did not remember her aspirating the object. She was discharged from our hospital and placed under home care after removal surgery.", "Question": "What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

Due to the combination of hypoxemia and abnormal electrocardiograph (ECG) findings, she was advised to transfer to our hospital; the patient did not receive prenatal obstetric care in our hospital. The admitting diagnosis was cardiac insufficiency, cyanotic CHD (dubious) and scarred uterus. The physical examination revealed blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, a pulse of 90/min, a respiratory rate of 25/min, slightly cyanotic lips and the same on her cheeks, coarse breath sounds to auscultation in the lungs, and a regular heartbeat. A loud P2 and grade 3/6 systolic murmur was heard at the third and fourth ribs on the left edge of the sternum. The ECG showed sinus rhythm, complete right bundle branch block (CRBBB), first degree A-V block, inverted T wave, right ventricular hypertrophy, and severe cardiac clockwise rotation.\nThe obstetricians felt that the manifestations of cardiac insufficiency in the mother put her at high risk in a vaginal delivery. The fetus presented with abnormal heart rate variability, with no further evidence that the fetus was in a state of emergency. Considering that the mother had been in a condition of hypoxia, which would result in hypoxia in the baby, the obstetricians recommended emergency cesarean section for the benefit of both the mother and the baby.\nThe patient was transferred to the operating theater with a temperature of 36.8 \u00b0C, a heart rate of 92 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 23breaths/min, a blood pressure of 138/88 mmHg, and an oxygen saturation of 83-90% in air. With the administration of a fractional inspired concentration of oxygen (FiO2) of 0.5 to 0.6 via a Venturi mask, the patient\u2019s oxygen saturation increased from 88 to 92%. Peripheral venous access was sited, and a 400-ml bolus of compound sodium chloride was commenced, after which a radial arterial line was placed under local anesthesia for beat-to-beat blood pressure monitoring.\nCombined spinal-epidural anesthesia (single-shot spinal anesthesia) was administered in this case. The puncture point of spinal anesthesia was selected in the L2-3 interspace, and the procedure was performed using a needle-through-needle technique in the left lateral decubitus position. After cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could be slowly aspirated through the needle, doses of 1.4 ml of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine made up with 10% glucose for a hyperbaric solution that made it easy to adjust and control the anesthetic plane were injected into the subarachnoid space slowly towards the head, and an epidural catheter was inserted into the epidural space. The patient was then placed in the supine position with a left lateral tilt of at least 30 degrees; [] the patient\u2019s abdomen could be raised softly if necessary to relieve vena caval compression. Within 20 min later of the anesthetic injection, we tested the block height every 1-2 min and adjusted the head-up or head-down tilt position to strictly control the blockade under the level of T6-8. Twenty minutes later, the level of spinal block was static at T8. One minute later, the patient was returned to the supine position, with a slight decrease arterial pressure to 122/82 mmHg and a heart rate of 97 beats/min. As small doses of metaraminol could resist the vasodilatation caused by anesthesia to maintain the afterload, 100 \u03bcg of metaraminol was administered, after which the patient\u2019s arterial pressure increased to 130/84 mmHg, with a heart rate of 91 beats/min.\nDuring the entire procedure, the key for safely administering anesthesia on such a patient was to keep her blood pressure stable and to carefully address the side effects of the changes in the hemodynamics []. Because the spinal anesthesia took action faster and due to the rapid sympathectomy in the intra-vertebral anesthesia, great care should be taken of the changes in arterial pressure and heart rate after puncture and injection.\nA male baby was smoothly delivered 10 min after the surgery began; the baby had Apgar scores of 8 at 1 min and 9 at 5 min. In addition to the caution that must be paid due to the change in the patient\u2019s venous return at the time of the delivery of the baby, some factors need to be given attention to avoid the occurrence of great amounts of intra-cardiac shunt changes and even heart failure. First, because the oppression of the inferior vena cava was relieved after childbirth, the lower limb venous blood flow increased rapidly, and the venous return increased in a short amount of time as a result. Abdominal sandbags were adopted to add pressure to reduce the returned blood volume. Further, the maternal \u201cautologous blood transfusion effect\u201d had to be considered: after the fetus was delivered, the myometrium contracted, and intrauterine blood flowed back to the blood vessels rapidly, thereby increasing the cardiac preload in a short amount of time. If the initial transfusion was too great, it could lead to heart failure. According to the patient\u2019s fluctuations in blood pressure, a bolus of ephedrine 3 mg or metaraminol 100 \u03bcg was used to restore the blood pressure to 130 ~ 140/82 ~ 87 mmHg, with a heart rate of 90 ~ 98 beats/min and an SpO2 of 89 ~ 93% during the surgery. The goal was to balance the preload and afterload and to try to maintain the intra-cardiac shunt in the preoperative level of stability.\nUterine atony was noted by the surgeon after delivery of the placenta. Oxytocin is usually administered to increase the contractions so as to reduce bleeding; however, a rapid infusion of oxytocin could increase the patient\u2019s heart rate, reduce the cardiac output and coronary blood flow, and break the balance of the intra-cardiac shunt, which could lead to cardiac insufficiency. Therefore, the application of oxytocin must begin with small doses, and the dosage should be adjusted over time. Thus, oxytocin (10 mIU/min) was intravenously infused, and the infusion was adjusted in accordance with the patient\u2019s changes in heart rate and blood pressure. Continuous post-cesarean analgesia was provided through an epidural catheter. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and was then sent to the ward in stable condition the following day.\nWe advised the patient to have an echocardiogram examination, which revealed CHD, a single atrium, and defects of the endocardial cushions (Fig. ). Thus, we made a complementary diagnosis of CHD: single atrium. The patient was in good condition at the 6-month follow-up.", "Question": "What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

He presented with progressive heart failure that could not be alleviated by inotropic or vasodilating drugs and had been coughing for 10 days. The symptoms had aggravated, and he had been unable to keep supine position for the last 3 days. He denied any previous heart disease. He had a history of right elbow leiomyosarcoma and underwent resection surgery 1 year previously.\nOn physical examination, the patient showed orthopnea and a compulsive position of slight left tilting. Wet rales could be heard on bilateral lung base. III/6 diastolic rumble was heard through the apex of the heart, which attenuated with upright position.\nThe preoperative laboratory data were within normal limits, except for NT-proBNP 1,190 pg/L. The electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia and minor ST segment change. Chest X-ray demonstrated prominent pulmonary patches infiltration, suggesting possible pulmonary edema. A mass was noted on the left lung. Combined with the malignancy history of the patient, pulmonary metastasis was suspected, whereas primary pulmonary tumor could not be ruled out (). Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a mobile isoechoic to hyperechoic lumpy mass (54\u00d727 mm, ) and medium pulmonary hypertension (67 mmHg), and the ejection fraction of the left ventricle was 65%.\nAccording to symptoms of left-sided heart failure, signs of mitral stenosis, and ultrasound imaging, myxoma was highly suspected. The TTE image indicated that the mass originated from the posterior wall of the left atrium (the typical myxoma is pedunculated with a stalk commonly attached to the fossa ovalis of interatrial septum). Differential diagnoses included idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH), pulmonary embolism, pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There is not enough evidence to support the differential diagnoses above.\nIn the operating room, monitors consisting of noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), five-lead electrocardiogram, and pulse oximetry (SpO2) were applied. Radial arterial line and central venous catheter in the right subclavian vein were inserted, and then, arterial blood pressure (ABP) and central venous pressure (CVP) were monitored. Vital signs of the patient were basically stable with continuous intravenous nitroglycerin at the rate of 0.5 \u03bcg/kg/min. ABP was 121/82 mmHg, and CVP was 8 cmH2O, while heart rate (HR) was 111 bpm. His SpO2 was 92%\u201393% (fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO2] 60%). Airway assessment indicated several risk factors: obesity, short neck, impaired neck mobility, and Mallampati classification grade III. When the patient was awake with topical anesthesia of the tongue and pharynx, partial glottis was observed (Cormack\u2013Lehane 2b) with direct laryngoscope. Thus, we considered the mask ventilation was feasible and anesthesia induction was conducted. After preoxygenation with oxygen (10 L/min) for 5 min via a face mask, general anesthesia was induced using Renfushufen\u00ae (sufentanil) 1 \u03bcg/kg, etomidate 0.15 mg/kg, and rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg (ideal body weight). Orotracheal intubation was performed with video laryngoscope when the patient was kept in the 60\u00b0 Semi-Fowler\u2019s position to avoid circulation collapse. Because mitral valve occlusion by left atrial mass may result in low cardiac output. Volume-controlled ventilation was applied (tidal volume of 8 mL/kg, frequency adjusted to maintain partial pressure of carbon dioxide in artery [PaCO2] between 35 and 45 mmHg, and inspiratory/expiratory (I/E) ratio 1:2). The airway peak pressure was 28\u201330 cmH2O. After intubation, the SpO2 was only 90%\u201393% (FiO2 60%). Arterial gas analysis during surgery is shown in . Abnormalities of airway, breathing, drug effects, and equipment were not found; thus, pulmonary edema was considered as the main reason for hypoxia. FiO2 100% was provided to improve oxygenation. Respiratory rate was increased to enhance minute ventilation volume. Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) was supplied to prevent alveoli from collapsing to improve pulmonary compliance and gas exchange and to decrease extravascular lung water. PEEP was titrated to 6 cmH2O to avoid high PEEP-related compromise preload. Then, SpO2 improved to 94%\u201395%. Vital signs and ventilation parameters during surgery are shown in . Anesthesia was maintained with sufentanil 20 \u03bcg/h and sevoflurane 2%\u20132.5% (concentration of sevoflurane was adjusted according to the patient\u2019s increased age), and rocuronium was given intermittently.\nAfter median sternotomy, 400 U/kg heparin was administered. Arterial cannulation was performed via ascending aorta. Venous cannulation was inserted via the right atrial appendage into the superior and inferior vena cava. After CPB was established, oxygenation of the patient improved significantly with the SpO2 improved to 99%\u2013100%. The patient was kept anesthetized with midazolam 0.1 mg/kg/h, sufentanil 0.15 \u03bcg/kg/h, and rocuronium 0.15 mg/kg/h intravenously under hypothermic CPB, and nasopharyngeal and rectal temperature were maintained at 25\u00b0C and 28\u00b0C, respectively. Activated clotting time (ACT) was performed intermittently, and the results are shown in .\nUnder direct view, the mass was large and occupied nearly the entire left atrium. The right atrium and atrial septum were incised, and the mass was found attached by a stalk to the opening of the left superior pulmonary vein. The mass in the left atrium was totally resected, and was 15\u00d72 cm. The tumor in the left superior pulmonary vein could not be completely resected, and palliative resection of the tumor around the opening of the left superior pulmonary vein was performed to ease tumor-related symptoms. As a result, preload was improved while pulmonary hypertension remained a problem. After rewarming and deairing of the heart, the aortic cross-clamp was removed. The heart came back into sinus rhythm with 20J intracardiac defibrillation, and then, the CPB was discontinued gradually. Weaning was facilitated with norepinephrine 0.05 \u03bcg/kg/min and dopamine 5 \u03bcg/kg/min to achieve goal mean arterial BP.65 mmHg. Nitroglycerin 0.5\u20130.8 \u03bcg/kg/min was used to decrease systemic vascular resistance. A total of 800 mL of packed red blood cells were gradually infused to increase preload. Vital signs showed an ABP of 110/70 mmHg, an HR of 110 bpm, a CVP of 12 cmH2O, and an SpO2 of 93%\u201395%. Heparin was neutralized with protamine (1 mg/100 U heparin). The total CPB time was 100 min, and the aortic occlusion time was 85 min. The overall fluid balance during CPB was \u22122,700 mL. The estimated blood loss was 800 mL. Arterial blood gas analysis after CPB discontinuation is also showed in .\nAfter CPB, the partial pressure of oxygen in artery (PaO2) was 68 mmHg with FiO2 100% and PEEP 6 cmH2O and was increased from that before tumor resection (48 mmHg). After excluding bronchospasm and acute lung injury, we assumed that this was due to unrelieved cardiogenic pulmonary edema and pulmonary hypertension, as well as residual tumor in the pulmonary vessels. Inotropic agents including epinephrine 0.05 \u03bcg/kg/min, dopamine 5 \u03bcg/kg/min, and nitroglycerin 0.5\u20130.8 \u03bcg/kg/min were continuously used to improve cardiac output and facilitate stable hemodynamics, so as to alleviate pulmonary edema. Hyperventilation was applied to decrease PaCO2 and prevent acidosis. Hypoxia pulmonary vasoconstriction may have been partially inhibited, and pulmonary artery systolic pressure was decreased from 67 to <35 mmHg (postoperative TTE). The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit with BP 110/71 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, and SpO2 95% during admission. Oxygenation was improved compared to the level before left atrial tumor resection (91 vs 48 mmHg), and HR was decreased (103 vs 111 bpm), indicating that pulmonary edema was partially relieved. Increasing FiO2, decreasing O2 consumption, and optimizing acid\u2013base balance and hemoglobin, together with protective ventilation, were provided and resulted in oxygenation improvement. Vasoactive medications and mechanical ventilation were gradually weaned, and vital signs remained stable. Chest X-ray performed 3 h postoperatively revealed significantly relieved pulmonary edema (). The patient was extubated on postoperative day 4 while he was conscious, and the vital signs showed BP 121/72 mmHg, HR 72 bpm, and SpO2 95%\u201397% with FiO2 85%. He was discharged 10 days after the surgery with symptoms ameliorated and SpO2 97% with FiO2 21%. Histopathological examination of the resected lesion revealed features consistent with leiomyosarcoma. Further management of the lung metastasis of leiomyosarcoma and possible radiation therapy are needed. Some authors suggest that multimodal therapy (surgical resection, radiation treatment, and chemotherapy) may result in reasonable survival improvement for patients. Isambert et al reported a mean survival of 18.2 months after incomplete resection and 11.2 months in nonresected patients. In our case, the patient received palliative treatment after surgery and died of tumor-related cardiopulmonary failure 6 months later.

The pain in his right leg progressively worsened and he presented to our outpatient clinic after one month.\nOn physical examination, the patient was slightly obese with a height of 161 cm and weight of 63 kg noted. His right leg was externally rotated, and he hesitated to stand up. The passive range of motion of the right hip was limited, especially in adduction and internal rotation (right/left; flexion 90\u00b0/120\u00b0, extension 10\u00b0/10\u00b0, abduction 45\u00b0/45\u00b0, adduction 0\u00b0/30\u00b0, external rotation 60\u00b0/45\u00b0, and internal rotation 10\u00b0/30\u00b0).

At a certain moment, she felt the drooping shoulder with a popping sound. She was born via spontaneous full-term vaginal delivery with a normal APGAR score. She had no specific family history of nerve or muscle diseases. Her growth and developmental history was nonspecific before the onset of winged scapula. Upon the physical examination, a winging deformity of the right scapula was noticed with the lateral deviation and upward rotation of the inferior angle, as observed on the erect neutral posture (). This abnormality was not detected when both shoulders were abducted (), but it was aggravated by shoulder flexion (). The motor and sensory functions of the upper extremities were normal and no side to side differences were revealed. The deep tendon reflexes of the biceps and triceps muscles were normoactive and symmetrical. No significant muscle atrophy in the shoulder girdles and the upper extremities was observed. On the laboratory tests, the routine complete blood count with differential counting, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, rheumatoid arthritis factor and urinalysis were normal, and the muscle enzyme tests, including serum creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and transaminase, were also normal. Simple radiological studies, including the chest posterior-anterior view, both the shoulder anterior-posterior views and the scapular view, were nonspecific except for the slight scapular asymmetry.\nWe examined the nerves by conducting an electrodiagnostic examination that included the long thoracic nerve, the dorsal scapular nerve and the spinal accessory nerves and the muscles including serratus anterior, levator scapula, trapezius and rhomboideus and so on; there were no definitive evidences that indicated any neuropathy or myopathy on electrodiagnosis.\nWhen the pain and functional impairment persisted, surgical intervention then became appropriate.

We can observed that the rhomboidius major was ruptured and trapezius lower thoracic bundle displayed thinning (). The right scapula was unstable to the chest wall. Rhomboideus major and trapezius muscle repair and reefing were performed. After the muscle repair, the scapula was stable to chest wall at the time of the operation.\nPostoperatively, she achieved the anatomical restoration of her right shoulder and she received rehabilitative treatment for 2 weeks including range of motion exercise of the shoulder and strengthening exercise of the rhomboideus muscles.

To evaluate her bilateral shoulder function, her active range of motion (ROM) (), sulcus sign, and shoulder instability in each direction were measured on the time point at the beginning of intervention A. Her passive ROM was not able to be measured because her humeral head was dislocated so easily with passive ROM exercise. Muscle strength was also difficult to measure due to dislocation with ease. Although her humeral head dislocated many times during rehabilitation, the doctor allowed her rehabilitation because there was no increase of persistent pain and she could centralize her humeral head voluntarily. The modified Rowe score was measured to evaluate shoulder instability [] ().\nEDS patients usually suffer from many musculoskeletal symptoms, even when they grow up []. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that patients who have shoulder MDI will recover shoulder function during movement after rehabilitation programs [, ]. However, the prognosis of this patient was challenging because patients with EDS were excluded from the rehabilitation programs.\nThe AB design includes some measurement of outcome variables throughout a baseline control/comparison phase A and then throughout another intervention phase B []. In the early part of rehabilitation, the patient was provided with an exercise program for MDI with orthosis [] (intervention A). The term was continued for 3 months. In summary, she performed shoulder isometric muscle exercises using the TheraBand (Hygenic, Akron, Ohio) for the rotator muscles and scapula stabilizers with supervision by a physical therapist. The program includes five exercises: resistance exercises of shoulder abduction, internal rotation, external rotation, extension, and flexion. Assistance from a physical therapist to stabilize the humeral head was often needed so as not to dislocate it. The resistance during exercise was gradually increased according to her performance regarding shoulder dislocation. A physical therapy session was provided one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. Compliance of home exercises was no more than about twice a week.\nIn the latter part of rehabilitation, the patient was instructed to perform the Watson program for MDI [, , ] (intervention B). The Watson program is an exercise program that aims for coordination of scapular muscles with strengthening rotator cuff and deltoid muscle. This phase also lasted for 3 months. In summary, this program consists of six stages that focus on retraining specific scapular control before any deltoid and rotator cuff exercise. The patient should make progress with exercise into functional and sport-specific ranges. She also received a physical therapy session one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. In the first stage, correction of her humeral head by a physical therapist was effective during shoulder movement. The scapular control exercise was performed with assistance. She could make progress to stage 2 within 1 month. She could finally perform stage 5 exercises after 2 more months of rehabilitation. Compliance of home exercises was more than 3 days a week.\nThe intervention was performed from July 2017 to January 2018. The patient was followed up until July 2018. The active ROM increased, while the passive ROM was not increased, due to easy dislocation (). The sulcus sign was still positive after intervention and at the time point of the final evaluation. The shoulder instability score was improved after intervention B (). She felt no pain and discomfort during writing motion after the time point. She could also control both humeral heads within proper position during ADL. A fair outcome was achieved by the final evaluation.", "Question": "What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

Prior to age 17, his medical history was unremarkable. His parents and 7 siblings are all healthy.\nAt the time of initial symptom onset, the patent lived in the Simanjiro district for cattle herding, while the rest of his family members lived in the suburban area of Arusha. He reported several insect bites during his period of working as a cattle herder. His symptoms gradually worsened with increasing weight loss and splenomegaly and as well as skin rashes and maculae in his face. After a year, he sought treatment from traditional healers. After another year of no improvement from consultation of the traditional healer, he presented to an outside hospital in the Arusha region (unknown diagnostic and treatment approach). Eventually, he was admitted at KCMC for further diagnostics.\nOn admission to KCMC, the patient\u2019s primary complaints were abdominal pain and swelling.

On abdominal exam, his spleen was enlarged 18 cm below costal margin; the liver was enlarged 3 cm below costal margin; there were traditional healer marks throughout the abdomen; there were no palpable lymph nodes; and the lungs and heart were normal. His skin exam demonstrated hypopigmented maculae scattered on his face with accentuation in the perioral region () and skin-colored maculae on his trunk and arms. The latter occurred a few months before presentation in the hospital. Alopecia areata was also noted.\nHis travel history includes a 3-month stay in Mombasa (Kenya), approximately 1 year prior to presentation, where he worked as a merchant. Travels to other areas in Kenya or other countries, especially to endemic VL areas, has been denied by the patient as well as travels within Tanzania.\nDue to pancytopenia, the patient was referred to the Hematology section of the Cancer Care Centre at KCMC, where we performed bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, revealing Leishmania amastigotes in macrophages (Figs and ). The rapid test for Leishmania antibody detection (IT LEISH) from the peripheral blood and the bone marrow aspirate remained negative.\nAfter discussion with senior experts in tropical diseases, we decided to reperform bone marrow aspiration for PCR in a reference laboratory, which found the aspirate positive for Leishmania species DNA.\nDue to the unavailability of liposomal Amphotericin, we initiated treatment with Amphotericin B (1 mg/kg IV).

There was an anion gap of 20, lactic acid of 4.8 mmoles/L, serum lipase of 1540 U/L, amylase 406 unit/L, gamma GT 25 unit/L, INR 1.3, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 950 unit/L; cancer antigen CA 19-9 was 49.9 \u03bc/mL, TSH was 2.25 mIU/L, serum acetone was negative, and alcohol level was less than 10 mg/dL. His serial cardiac enzymes were negative and he was ruled out for an acute coronary event.\nChest X-ray (CXR) revealed bilateral patchy airspace disease. CT of abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed diffuse enlargement of the pancreas with homogeneous attenuation and without significant peripancreatic inflammation () with extensive retroperitoneal and pelvic adenopathy (). A para-aortic lymph node measuring 2.1 cm and retrocaval lymph node measuring 1.6 cm were seen. A soft tissue density surrounding the right common iliac vessels likely representing confluent adenopathy was seen. His echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 67%; right ventricle systolic pressure was estimated to be 44 mm Hg. Pericardium was normal without any pericardial effusion. There was no significant valvular abnormality.\nInitially, the patients EKG showed 2nd degree Mobitz type I block which later progressed to complete heart block. Patient was given atropine without improvement; hence, a temporary pacemaker was inserted. He was started on IV hydration and IV antibiotics and all his electrolyte abnormalities were corrected. His temporary pacemaker lead came out and it was removed. Subsequently he became unresponsive, was orally intubated, had four cardiac arrests, and was successfully resuscitated. Due to persistent pulmonary infiltrates he underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsies which showed evidence of pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP). He was started on Bactrim for the treatment of PJP. He tested positive for HIV and was found to have a CD 4 count of 12/uL.\nA temporary pacemaker wire was again placed after ruling out the relevant reversible causes of third degree heart block. A repeat echocardiogram was unchanged from prior one. CT-guided biopsy of the para-aortic lymph nodes was consistent with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with marked tumor necrosis (). Immunoprofile showed that CD 20 (), CD 79a, and CD 10 were positive. CD 43, CD 3, CD 7, and BcL were negative. Upper endoscopy for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement showed gastric polyps which revealed gastric lymphoma on biopsy.\nPatient was not a candidate for chemotherapy or ART due to critical condition.

He was treated with an intravenous saline infusion, subcutaneous calcitonin, and intravenous glucocorticoids, followed by intravenous bisphosphonates. Due to his persistent hypercalcemia he was subsequently given 120 mg denosumab (Prolia). During hospitalization, there was significant improvement in his mental status concurrently with the normalization of his calcium level, which was 9.44 mg/dl at discharge.\nHis past history was remarkable for his 2016 diagnosis of Rai stage IV chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The fluorescence in situ hybridization reaction revealed the deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del (17p)) in 20% of B-cell lymphocytes. In addition, in a bone marrow biopsy, the patient was found to have unmutated IGHV gene status and ZAP 70 expression in leukemia cells.\nIn 09/2017 he was admitted to the Department of Internal Medicine because of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Treatment with a high dose glucocorticoid was started, followed by a slow tapering down of the dose. In 12/2017 he was again admitted to the Department of Internal Medicine with left hemiparesis, dysarthria, and left facial nerve palsy. Complete right carotid occlusion was found in the CT angiography.\nAfter discharge, he was treated with 2 courses of a Rituximab + Bendamustine protocol with a significant decrease in lymphocytes counts. In September 2018 treatment with the second line agent Ibrutinib was started. One month later, he developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm. Six days before the present admission, the patient was hospitalized because of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with no evidence of myocardial ischemia. Ibrutinib was stopped because it was presumed to be the cause of the arrhythmia. During his present hospitalization additional laboratory tests revealed an elevated LDH level of 2250 U/l (reference range: 230\u2013480), an alkaline phosphatase level of 220 U/l (reference range: 30\u2013120), and low levels of PTH: 4.8 pg/ml (reference range: 18.4\u201381), 25 hydroxyvitamin D level of 52 mmol/l (reference range: 75\u2013220) with normal 1.25 dihydroxyvitamin D level of 61.3 nmol/l (reference range: 50\u2013190), WBC 108.000 (reference range: 4.5\u201311.5 K/\u03bcl), Lymphocytes 57%, PLT count of 88.000 (reference range: 150\u2013450 K/\u03bcl).\nIn the setting of his elevated LDH level, further decrease in his PLT level to 45.000 and severe hypercalcemia, it was decided to perform a positron emission tomography/computed tomography to assess the possibility of Richter transformation. The scan revealed a 1.3 cm nodule with an intensive uptake of tracer in the upper left lobe of the lung and in vertebra D 7, suspicious of metastasis (Fig. ).\nHe underwent a bronchoscopy with a transbronchial biopsy of the lesion. Non-small cell carcinoma displaying positive CK 7 and negative to TTF-1, napsin-A, and p 40 immunostaining was diagnosed. An epidermal growth factor genotype was negative for mutations. Immunohistochemical analysis was negative for ALK and ROS1 protein rearrangement as well as PDL1 expression. He underwent 1 course of chemotherapy in September 2019 that included carboplatin, paclitaxel, and pembroluzumab. Results of the molecular analysis of the tumor were negative for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) genotype mutations, ALK and ROS 1 rearrangement, and PDL-1 protein expression. He then began treatment with venetoclax for his refractory CLL.\nTen days after starting therapy with venetoclax, he was admitted to the internal medicine department with large left upper lobe pneumonia. A chest CT revealed a large infiltrate with an air bronchogram. A subsequent urine antigen test was positive for legionella pneumonia. He completed treatment with respiratory quinolone for 21 days and was returned to oncological and hematological supervision.\nThe patient received a second course of chemotherapy, but 4 days later he was admitted with suspected pneumonia and despite the broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment, respiratory failure developed and he passed away.", "Question": "Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

It was found that the patient had osteoporosis in her history but did not receive any treatment. In the physical examination of the patient, who did not present any characteristics in her family history, the liver extended to 2 cm below the costal margin. She did not have ascites or splenomegaly. Heart and lung examinations were normal. Laboratory tests presented a normal hemogram. Biochemical tests revealed an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 50 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 20 U/L, total bilirubin level of 1.3 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level of 101 U/L, gamma-glutamyltransferase level of 227 U/L, albumin level of 2.6 g/dL, total protein level of 4.9 g/dL, calcium level of 12,35 mg/dL, and a phosphate level of 2.6 mg/dL. The patient was hospitalized in order to investigate the etiology of hypercalcemia. The patient had a parathormone level of 9.5 pg/mL. These results excluded a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. The patient who was thought to have malignant hypercalcemia was started on intravenous fluid replacement and furosemide treatment. The patient who manifested a creatinine clearance of 55.5 mL/min/1.73 m2 was started on 2 mg zoledronic acid treatment. Tomography scans demonstrated no osteolytic bone lesions. During follow-up, the patient's calcium levels regressed to 9.7 mg/dL with the specified treatment. Abdominal ultrasonography performed due to right upper quadrant pain and hepatomegaly revealed multiple hypoechoic images in the liver, of which the largest was 1.5 cm in size, and a coarsely granular parenchyma. The dynamic CT of the patient demonstrated hypodense lesions with multiple areas of peripheral contrast enhancement that were particularly congregated in the right lobe, the largest of which had a size of 47 \u00d7 32 mm, and this was interpreted as metastasis (Figure ).\nLevels of alpha-fetoprotein were determined as 91 ng/mL, cancer antigen (CA-125) as 258.6 U/mL, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as 0.82 ng/mL, and cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) as 2.1 U/mL.

Serum calcium was 8.3 mg/dl and serum albumin was 3.2 mg/dl. Glycosylated haemoglobin was 6.0, revealing adequate blood glucose control. Electrocardiogram showed evidence of old inferior wall myocardial infarction. Echocardiography showed normal left ventricular function with mild hypertrophy. She was on tablet aspirin 75 mg once daily (OD) orally for antithrombotic prophylaxis.\nIn view of her cardiac history, adequate perioperative analgesia was needed along with general anaesthesia. Thus, right sided continuous erector spinae block along was planned in combination with general anaesthesia.\nPreoperative antibiotic prophylaxis was administered with injection cefuroxime 1.5 g intravenous (IV). Under ultrasound guidance, a continuous erector spinae block was performed at L3 level. After explaining the procedure, consent was taken from the patient. She was placed in left lateral position for right sided block since we found it ergonomically easy to hold the ultrasound probe (high frequency linear probe) with left hand and place it transversely. An 18-guage tuohy needle was approached in-plane lateral to medial. When the needle initially touched the transverse process of L3 vertebrae, the needle was gently withdrawn and hydrodissection of the plane was achieved, lifting the erector spinae muscle. A 20-guage catheter was introduced through the needle and total length inserted was 3 cm more than the tip of needle. The catheter was secured properly for perioperative use. The patient was hydrated with 10 ml/kg of ringer lactate before induction of anaesthesia. Anaesthesia was induced with injection fentanyl 75 mcg iv and injection propofol 100 mg iv and laryngeal mask airway (LMA) size 3 was inserted. Anaesthesia was maintained with FiO20.5 (nitrous oxide and oxygen mixture) and sevoflurane. A bolus dose of 20 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine was given through the catheter placed in erector spinae plane. The procedure was uneventful with no haemodynamic disturbances and minimal blood loss. After surgery, inhalational anaesthetics were stopped, and LMA was removed. Patient had an uneventful recovery.

She reported that the rash developed over a period of 3 months with an intermittent response to prednisone therapy. Three weeks prior to presentation, the rash became progressively worse. She developed fevers came on one week prior to presentation. The rash started on her arms and progressively spread. She admitted associated shortness of breath accompanied by a productive cough with green, bloody sputum, as well as nausea and vomiting. Patient reported compliance with her home dose of prednisone but may have not taken her mycophenolate mofetil regularly. She missed two sequential hemodialysis sessions due to pain with walking from the blistering rash on her soles of the feet.\nHer physical exam was significant for fever of 100.6\u00b0F and tachycardia with heart rate of 130 beats per minute. Skin exam was evident for brown plaques on the forehead and bilateral cheeks with sparing of the nasolabial folds, with erosions and hemorrhagic crust involving the philtrum, ears, forehead, nose, chin, and lips. There were dark brown plaques with few erosions and atrophic scars on bilateral forearms and lower legs with deep red to violaceous painful targetoid lesions on the palms and plantar surfaces (Figures and ). The skin over the trunk had pink eroded macules, and there were pink patches on the back within a background of dusky necrotic plaques. There were multiple full-thickness epidermal necroses with large areas of bleeding with the denuded skin on the arms and chest in the sun exposed distribution (). Oral mucosae were negative for any oral lesions.\nPatient was found to be pancytopenic with white blood cell count (WBC) 2.03 (Ref: 3.4\u201310.8 \u00d7 103/UL), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.25 (Ref: 1.4\u20137.0 \u00d7 103/UL), hemoglobin (Hb) 8.8 g/dL (Ref: 11.1\u201315.9 g/dL), hematocrit (Hct) 28.9% (Ref: 34\u201346%), platelet 69 (150\u2013450 \u00d7 103/UL), sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 98 mmol/L, CO2 21 mmol/L, BUN 41 mg/dL (Ref: 6\u201320 mg/dL), Cr 5.49 mg/dL (Ref: 0.57\u20131.0 mg/dL), calcium 7.2 mg/dL (8.7\u201310.2 mg/dL), albumin 3.2 g/dL, phosphorous 5.0 mg/dL (Ref: 1.2\u20132.2 mg/dL), AST 286 IU/L (Ref 0\u201340 IU/L), ALT 31 IU/L (0\u201332 IU/L), total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 136 IU/L, CK 91 U/L, serum lactate was 0.80 mmol/L, and ferritin was 5885 ng/mL (Ref: 15\u201350 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray did not show any lung infiltrates or effusions. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not show an acute abdominal process, and the liver demonstrated normal echogenicity, echotexture, and size; the spleen was not enlarged. Sputum gram stain and cultures were unremarkable. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and yeast. Patient was anuric due to chronic dialysis. Evaluation of lupus activity showed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody 42 IU/mL (Ref: 0\u20139 IU/L). Complement 3 (C3) was 43 mg/dL (Ref: 90\u2013180 mg/dL) and complement 4 (C4) was 9 mg/dL (Ref: 10\u201340 mg/dL). Rheumatoid factor was negative. Sjogren's anti-SSA was >8.0 AI (Ref: 0\u20130.9 AI) and Sjogren's anti-SSB was <0.2 AI (Ref: 0\u20130.9 AI). HIV screen was negative, and viral hepatitis panels for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Skin biopsies showed focal interface changes, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for fungal microorganisms. Gram stain highlighted surface cocci bacteria. VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus.\nGiven her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven\u2013Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3\u2013858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome.\nDue to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases.\nIt was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) was 0 at 12-week follow-up.", "Question": "Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

On the postnatal day six, a distended abdomen was noticed and baby was admitted to another hospital for investigations. On abdominal examination firm mass was palpable. The liver was occupying the entire abdomen. The patient also had edema of the lower extremities and mild respiratory distress.\nInitial laboratory findings including complete blood count (hemoglobin: 14.6 g/dl, white blood count: 22,800 /l, platelet count: 330,000/l), electrolytes and renal function tests were within normal range. Alanine aminotransferase level (19 U/l, N: <45 U/l) was normal. However aspartate aminotransferase (85 U/l, N: <41 U/l), gamma glutamyl transferase (238 U/l, N: 8-61 U/l) and total/direct bilirubin levels (3/1.6 mg/dl, N: <1.1/<0.3 mg/dl) were high. Serological evaluation for toxoplasma gondii, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, Epstein\u2013Barr virus and parvovirus were all negative. Abdominal ultrasonography (USG) revealed hepatomegaly with a heterogeneous liver parenchyma and a 39x31 mm hypo-echoic solitary non-calcified mass in the right adrenal region. A computed tomography scan revealed a right adrenal soft tissue mass (4.8x3.6 cm) with no calcification and contrast uptake, and significant hepatomegaly. The spleen appeared to be in normal size but was replaced inferiorly because of the massive hepatomegaly. Serum neuron-specific enolase level was higher, 60 ng/mL (normal range: <10 ng/mL), and alpha feto protein level (22754 ng/mL, N: >45000 ng/mL at birth) was normal. Urine vanillylmandelic acid and serum ferritin levels were 5718 mg/day (N: 0.5-2 mg/day) and 531 ng/mL (N: 24-336 ng/mL) retrospectively. Bone marrow aspiration revealed no malignant infiltration, no rosette forming and no storage cells. On the postnatal day eighteen, doppler USG showed decreased flow in the IVC, secondary to compression. Based on clinical presentation and imaging modalities, the presumptive diagnosis of NBL was made and the case was referred to our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) on the postnatal day twenty.\nOn admission to our NICU, he had respiratory distress with 40% O2 requirement and significant abdominal distension with visible thin venous vessels through his abdominal skin (Fig. 1a). He had tachypnea besides edema of lower extremities, scrotum and penile area. Complete blood count revealed anemia (hemoglobin: 9.5 g/dl), leukocytosis (33.300 /l) and mild thrombocytosis (536.000/l). Serum sodium (128 mEq/l), chloride (94 mEq/l), calcium (7 mg/dl) and phosphorus (0.7 mg/dl) concentrations were low. Serum uric acid and renal function tests revealed normal results (uric acid: 5.8 mg/dl, blood urea nitrogen: 9 mg/dl, creatinine: 0.43 mg/dl). Liver function tests revealed cholestasis (alanine aminotransferase: 40 U/l, aspartate aminotransferase: 101 U/l, \u03b3-glutamyltransferase: 463 U/l, total/direct bilirubin: 3.05/2.02 mg/dl) and hypoproteinemia (total protein: 3.4 g/dl and albumin: 1.8 g/dl).

After pediatric oncology consultation, the patient underwent hydration, chemotherapy and allopurinol treatments between the postnatal days 20\u201323. The patient received modified VEC (vincristine, etoposide, carboplatin) protocol due to poor clinical condition. In spite of the received chemotherapy, his clinical condition worsened progressively. The abdominal distention was so increased that he required high frequency oscillatory ventilation support. However, he did not develop signs of tumor lysis syndrome. The patient was accepted as chemotherapy-resistant NBL due to clinical deterioration with massive liver involvement on the 3rd day of treatment and surgical excision was performed (Fig. 1b, 1c). Pathology revealed intra-adrenal tumor with wide-spread expression of bcl 2 in addition to distant metastases in the liver and minimal lymphocytic infiltration. MYC-N amplification obtained from adrenal specimen revealed <3 copies.

The pain affected her walking such that she was \u201cwaddling\u201d to avoid the pain. On occasions the pain would radiate to the right leg as well as anterior and lateral thigh but not past the knee. There were no associated paresthesias or significant weakness. She denied history of cancer, weight loss, fever, chills, or night sweats. There was no history of nephrolithiasis or bone fractures. She was being treated for diabetes and hypertension. She had history of pulmonary emboli of unclear etiology in the 1990 s. Surgical history included cholecystectomy in 1994, uterine endometrial ablation in 1996, and bilateral carpal tunnel surgeries. She had an allergy to penicillin causing a rash and an intolerance to sulfa causing abdominal discomfort. The patient reported remote history of smoking for 15 years, quitting 25 years ago. Family history was negative for bone disease. Physical exam was remarkable for her being overweight. She had a side-to-side waddle in her gait and slightly lifted her feet on walking. Straight leg raising test was negative. She did not have tenderness to percussion of the lower back but did have a gibbous at L-4. There was no back pain with movement. She had weakness at the iliopsoas and quadriceps bilaterally but no loss of sensation. An outside MRI of the lumbar spine showed an infiltrative lesion in the L-4 vertebra with collapse of the body (confirmed on repeat MRI at our institution, ). CT scan confirmed a pathologic fracture of L-4 with a lytic lesion. A bone scan showed mildly increased radiotracer uptake at L-4, and additional uptake was seen in several lower thoracic ribs bilaterally, as well as the xiphoid process, upper right femur, and skull, suggesting metabolic bone disease. The L-4 lesion was hypermetabolic on PET scan (). Initial CT guided biopsy of the lesion was nondiagnostic demonstrating only bone, fibrous tissue, and cartilage. Laboratory testing was remarkable for low serum phosphorus of 1.5 mg/dL (2.5\u20134.5 mg/dL). Additional abnormalities included elevated serum calcium of 10.6 mg/dL (8.9\u201310.1 mg/dL), inappropriately high parathyroid hormone (PTH) of 120 pg/mL (15\u201365 pg/mL), low 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D of <8 pg/mL (18\u201378 pg/mL), and mildly elevated serum alkaline phosphatase of 162 u/L (45\u2013115 u/L). Serum albumin was normal at 4.0 g/dL (3.5\u20135.0 g/dL), serum creatinine was 1.2 mg/dL (0.6\u20131.1 mg/dL), and 25-hydroxyvitamin D was normal at 31 ng/mL (25\u201380 ng/mL). She had frank phosphaturia, especially for her level of serum phosphorus (772 mg, normal 0\u20131,099 mg). 24-hour urine calcium was low at 10 mg (20\u2013275 mg). Serum and urinary protein electrophoresis with immunofixation were normal. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was normal at 2.12 mIU/L (0.3\u20135.0 mIU/L). Parathyroid scan was normal. Plasma FGF-23 from a peripheral vein was significantly elevated at 3,500 RU/mL (<180 RU/mL), confirming TIO. Oral phosphate supplementation and calcitriol were prescribed. She was subsequently lost to followup from our medical center for two years, and when she returned, she reported that she had internal fixation with a rod placement for a spontaneous right femur fracture. She also had deep pain in her left thigh and was told by a local provider that she had a \u201cbrown tumor\u201d in the left femur based on plain radiographs. She had not been taking phosphate supplements or calcitriol on a regular basis. Repeat laboratory investigations continued to show a significantly low phosphorus of 1.4 mg/dL (2.5\u20134.5 mg/dL), high serum calcium of 10.6 mg/dL (8.9\u201310.1 mg/dL), elevated PTH of 229.1 pg/mL (10\u201365 pg/mL), and serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL (0.6\u20131.1 mg/dL). Plasma FGF-23 level remained significantly elevated at 4,460 RU/mL (<180 RU/mL). A repeat CT guided needle biopsy of L-4 showed a low grade spindle cell neoplasm with positive FGF-23 mRNA expression by RT-PCR (), confirming the diagnosis of mixed phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor (PMT). She suffered a spontaneous left peritrochanteric fracture requiring placement of an intramedullary device. The patient then elected to have surgery involving anterior resection of the L-4 vertebral body to complete total spondylectomy at this spinal level, along with corpectomy. Pathology of the resection specimen confirmed a spindle cell neoplasm consistent with PMTMCT. Six months after surgical resection, she was independent in activities of daily living but was using a walker for ambulation due to some difficulty walking and right foot drop. She was prescribed physical therapy. Follow-up laboratory testing revealed normal serum phosphorus at 2.5 mg/dL (2.5\u20134.5 mg/dL) and calcium of 9.6 mg/dL (8.9\u201310.1 mg/dL). PTH was 619 pg/mL (10\u201365 pg/mL). This is on minimal phosphate supplementation without calcitriol.

Special stains and cultures for acid-fast and fungal microorganisms showed negative results. Colonoscopy was normal including terminal ileum. CT scan of the chest and abdomen demonstrated multiple, small, centrolobularly distributed nodules within the acini of both lungs and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. Ophthalmological examination showed evidence of uveitis. ACE level was elevated at 135 U/L. Similar to Case 1, extensive investigations for infectious, immunologic, and inflammatory conditions associated with GIT granulomatous inflammation were negative.\nThe combination of tissue findings of granulomatous disease from upper GIT, elevated ACE, systemic involvement, and negative workup for infectious disease suggested systemic sarcoidosis with significant GI involvement. The patient received corticosteroids at 1 mg/kg/day and omeprazole, resulting in resolution of GI symptoms and normalization of activity markers and ACE level. Tapering of corticosteroids over 3 months led to relapse of the disease. Again, remission was induced by a course of steroids supplemented by mesalamine (Pentasa 50 mg/kg/day) and azathioprine (up to 2.5 mg/kg/day) to maintain remission. Throughout the 4-year follow up, the course of the disease was punctuated by several relapses on tapering of corticosteroids and later development of vitamin B12 deficiency anemia: hemoglobin 10.6 gm/dL, macrocytosis (MCV 102, normal 80\u201391 fL), hyperchromasia (MCH 34.5, normal 20\u201331 pg), low serum vitamin B12 119.2 pmol/L (normal 162\u2013638 pmol/L). Red blood cell folate level was normal at 16.2 nmol/L (normal, 10.4\u201342.2 nmol/L). Antigastric parietal cell antibodies were negative. The patient received weekly injections of vitamin B12 ( 1 mg weekly) for 6 weeks that raised the level to 231.8 pmol/L with correction of anemia and normalization of his peripheral blood picture.\nConsidering the steroid dependency of the disease and the short stature of the patient, he was commenced on infliximab 5 mg/kg administered intravenously at 0, 2 and 6 weeks and then every 8 weeks. The patient reported a significant subjective general improvement as well as resolution of his GI symptoms. ESR and ACE concentration returned to normal. A repeat of endoscopy after the 6th dose of infliximab infusion demonstrated loss of gastric folds pattern and loss of normal vascular pattern; otherwise there were no more erosions or friability.

Type 2 DM was diagnosed when he was 31 years old and initially treated with oral antihyperglycemic agents. The patient discontinued oral antidiabetic agents and started insulin therapy 4 years before admission. At that time, he was treated with long-acting insulin glargine and insulin aspart. This insulin regimen was switched to insulin degludec/liraglutide 3 months before admission. While he was on insulin degludec/liraglutide, his home blood glucose monitoring ranged from 110 to 70 mg/dL. Five days before admission, while on insulin degludec/liraglutide in a dose of 18 IU daily, the patient started having recurrent episodes of diaphoresis. During those episodes, usually in the early morning before breakfast, his blood glucose levels were below 50 mg/dL. The patient suffered from several further episodes despite insulin dosage tapering and even after discontinuation. His past medical history was notable for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, acute coronary syndrome, and osteomyelitis of the left foot. His family medical history included atrial fibrillation and DM. In addition to insulin, his therapy consisted in acetylsalicylic acid, bisoprolol, furosemide, ramipril, and atorvastatin. He denied oral antihyperglycemic agents. He had no known drug allergies, he was a former smoker, and he did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs.\nOn admission, the patient's blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg, heart rate was 71 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 98%, while he was breathing ambient air. The patient's body mass index was 26.7 kg/m2 (height: 173 cm; weight: 80 kg), and the physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory data on admission showed glucose 50 mg/dl, HbA1c 50 mmol/mol, normocytic anemia (hemoglobin 11.9 g/dL, hematocrit 34.8%, and mean corpuscular volume 85 fl), a normal white cell and platelet count, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 87 IU/L (normal range: 17\u201359), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 62 IU/l (normal range: 21\u201372), gamma glutamyl-transferase 545 IU/l (normal range: 15\u201373), alkaline phosphatase 177 IU/l (normal range: 38\u2013126), total bilirubin 0.47 mg/dL (normal range: 0.20\u20131.30), lactate dehydrogenase 1021 IU/L (normal range: 313\u2013618), albumin 3.5 g/dL (normal range: 3.6\u20135.5), INR 1.18, C-reactive protein 7.5 mg/dl (normal range: 0-1), erythrocyte sedimentation rate 90 mm/h (normal range: 0\u201315), fibrinogen 621 mg/dl (normal range: 170\u2013410), iron 37 \u03bcg/dl (normal range: 49\u2013181), and ferritin 776 ng/ml (normal range: 20\u2013325). Viral markers for hepatitis B and C were negative.\nFurther blood tests were ordered to rule out endogenous hyperinsulinism: C-peptide was 4.2 ng/mL (normal range: 0.5\u20133), insulin 89 \u03bcIU/mL (normal range: 5\u201325), while the patient's glucose level was 40 mg/dL, and sulfonylurea screening test was negative, confirming endogenous hyperinsulinism. Markers of neuroendocrine tumors were severely increased: chromogranin A (CgA) was 1790 ng/ml (normal range: 0\u2013100), and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) was 458 ng/ml (normal range: 0\u201311).\nGiven the high suspicion of insulinoma and the altered liver function tests on admission, a full-body CT scan was ordered. CT scan showed a 4.3 \u00d7 2.2 cm pancreatic tail mass containing calcifications with multiple regional lymphadenopathies (). Multiple liver secondary lesions were found: the largest ones measuring 12 and 11 cm, respectively, in II-III and IVb-V segments. No lungs, bone, and brain metastases were detected. Additionally, a thyroid nodule of 2.6 cm was incidentally found. Hepatic metastases were highly suspected to be secondary to a malignant insulinoma, so ultrasound-guided percutaneous biopsies of the lesion in the II-III segments were performed (). Histological findings of four core biopsies consisted of hepatocytes infiltrated by a poorly differentiated and focally necrotic proliferating tissue of medium-sized atypical epithelial cells with solid growth pattern (). The cancer cells showed hyperchromatic nuclei with \u201csalt and pepper\u201d chromatin markedly Ki-67 positive, high mitotic index (10 figures \u00d7 10 HPF), and scant cytoplasm. Immunohistochemistry studies revealed the neuroendocrine nature and the partial insulin secreting activity of the lesion; CgA, synaptophysin, CD56, and CAM5.2 were diffusely positive; there was patchy (<5%) insulin expression. Ki-67 index was 40\u201350. These findings were consistent with the diagnosis of metastatic, poorly differentiated (G3), neuroendocrine carcinoma with morphology and immunophenotype favoring a pancreatic primary tumor. Thyroid ultrasound () showed a weakly hypoechoic solid nodule (2.8 \u00d7 3.2 \u00d7 1.3 cm) with a central cystic component and regular margins located in the isthmus and a markedly hypoechoic solid nodule (0.9 \u00d7 0.9 \u00d7 0.6 cm) adjacent to the lower pole of the left lobe.

Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed hepatosplenomegaly and hypodense nonenhancing lesions throughout the liver (variable in size from a few millimeters to 3 centimeters), and multiple enlarged abdominal lymph nodes. Chest CT scan showed basal and peripheral nodular opacities. Tests for mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) including tuberculin skin test and serum QuantiFERON showed negative results. Liver biopsy showed noncaseating granulomas []. In light of the strong epidemiological exposure, antituberculous medications were initiated (combination of isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and refampicin). Despite compliance with treatment and proper dosing, the patient persisted to be febrile with further weight loss.\nThree months later, the patient presented with repeated episodes of hematemesis and epigastric pain.

The total dose of tPA administered was 80 mg. Following this, the patient was commenced on an unfractionated heparin (UHF) infusion, targeting an anti-Xa level of 0.3\u20130.7 U/mL. COCP administration was ceased.\nFollowing thrombolysis, the patient's tachycardia resolved, although she remained tachypneic. A repeat echocardiogram within twelve hours showed improvement in the RV systolic dysfunction and definite blood movement through the right pulmonary artery, with ongoing presence of a significant filling defect occupying the vessel. UHF infusion was continued for 48 hours, after which time anticoagulation was changed to 80 mg subcutaneous enoxaparin, a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), administered twice a day. Given the significant embolic material seen on the initial CTPA, further discussions ensued regarding the potential benefits and risks of catheter-directed intervention with the aim of decreasing clot burden and potentially reducing the risk of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH).\nA repeat CTPA was performed on the fourth day of admission which revealed a substantial decrease in clot burden, no visible saddle embolus, and reduced right heart strain (). The patient no longer required supplemental oxygen and made a steady recovery. Eight days post admission, she was transitioned to a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC), rivaroxaban, at standard adult dosing (15 mg twice a day for three weeks followed by 20 mg daily), prior to discharge home.\nA thrombophilia screen performed was unremarkable (). She was referred to an adolescent gynaecologist to explore suitable alternatives to taking the COCP. Outpatient spirometry, body plethysmography, and diffusing capacity tests performed a month post discharge were unremarkable. She returned to her baseline function with resolution of the shortness of breath on exertion. A CTPA and echocardiogram performed six months post presentation revealed complete resolution of all pathological changes, and rivaroxaban therapy was stopped ().

At that point, she had a slightly enlarged liver with normal liver function tests and massive renal cysts. She reached ESRD requiring RRT in 2005 and received a deceased donor kidney transplant 2 years later. She developed progressive graft dysfunction due to chronic allograft nephropathy that required starting PD in August 2014. In November 2014, she was admitted to our hospital with a 3-week history of lower limb edema with painful skin ulcers, symptomatic hypotension and tachycardia (118 bpm), anorexia, nausea, and incoercible vomiting. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 70/45 mm Hg and ulcers with necrotic areas and cellulitis in the external distal third of both legs. Laboratory findings revealed severe malnutrition (serum albumin 1.5 g/dL) and elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein: 288 mg/L; procalcitonin: 1.9 \u03bcg/L). A Doppler ultrasound showed bilateral femoral vein thrombosis, and so pulmonary thromboembolism was ruled out and due to the extensive thrombosis, a complete hypercoagulability state check was done, but no abnormalities were detected and tumor markers were normal. An abdominal CT was then performed showing large liver and renal polycystic disease, both organs with giant cysts (>15 cm). A giant hepatic cyst producing an extrinsic compression of the intrahepatic inferior cava vein (ICV) and massive venous thrombosis from ICV to bilateral iliofemoral deep veins involving the kidney graft vein was observed. The CT also demonstrated displacement and extrinsic compression of the stomach, pylorus, and duodenum due to another enlarged liver cyst, shown in Figures and .\nAfter the CT findings, we considered the clinical presentation was consistent with an ICV syndrome due to ICV compression and thrombosis. Furthermore, vomiting and oral intake intolerance with severe malnutrition were caused by a complete pyloric and duodenal collapse by the enlarged liver cyst.\nAnticoagulation therapy was started, but vomiting with oral intolerance persisted and the patient remained dependent on parenteral nutrition. Thus, percutaneous drainage and alcohol sclerosis of the compressive liver cyst was decided, with successful return of the stomach to its normal location, shown in Figure . Nausea and vomiting resolved in a few days, and adequate oral intake was resumed. Severe hypotension and tachycardia gradually improved, and a repeated CT revealed complete stomach expansion, as shown in Figure .

She reported a weight loss of 15 pounds in the past year. She had been a smoker but had quit five years prior to the presentation. Prior to this hospital visit, she had consulted an outpatient clinic with complaints of fever, chills, and cough. She had received a flu vaccine a month prior. She had been thought to have a viral respiratory infection as an outpatient. Ibuprofen, and later azithromycin, had been prescribed, which had not alleviated her initial symptoms before the current presentation.\nOn physical exam, she had a temperature of 39.3 \u00b0C in the emergency department. She was tachycardic at 130 beats per minute and tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Her blood pressure was 149/74 mmHg. She had bilateral conjunctival injection, but her eyelids were grossly unremarkable. There was left axillary lymphadenopathy. A physical breast exam was normal with no palpable masses. There was no other palpable adenopathy, skin rashes, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, clubbing, or edema. The respiratory and cardiovascular exams were otherwise unremarkable. Her ECG showed sinus tachycardia at 106 beats per minute but was otherwise unremarkable.\nRelevant laboratory workup included a leukocytosis of 16.7 Thou/uL (normal range: 3.8-10.2) with a neutrophilic predominance of 82.9%. She had chronic anemia with a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 8.9 g/dl (11.9-15.1) and a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 76 fL (78.2-98.4). Her ferritin was more than 7,500 ng/ml (11-307), with a total iron-binding capacity of 204 (250-450), and a low iron level of 37 ug/dl (50-212). Her angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level was 97 U/l (8-52). Her C-reactive protein (CRP) was 19.05 mg/dl (0.02-1.00), D-dimer was 13.46 ugFEU/ml (<0.50), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 54 U/L (13-39), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 66 U/L (7-52); she had calcium of 9.0 mg/dl (8.6-10.2), albumin of 3.0 g/dl (3.5-5.0), corrected calcium of 9.8 mg/dl, serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D level of 22.4 ng/ml (30-100), creatinine of 1.11 mg/dl (0.49-1.01), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 344 U/L (140-271).\nThe patient had not undergone a prior mammogram. A CT angiography (CTA) was performed, which ruled out any pulmonary embolus. There was no evidence of a pulmonary embolus, or pulmonary nodules, or infiltrates. However, the CTA revealed right hilar lymphadenopathy of 1.3 cm in size and subcarinal lymphadenopathy of 1.1 cm (Figures , ).\nA CT of the abdomen revealed a cystic mass of the left retroperitoneum measuring 14 x 11 x 6 cm. The official radiology report suggested that it was of a benign etiology, which could include cystic lymphangioma, mesenteric cyst, or duplication cyst. A cystic neoplasm was considered unlikely in the radiology report. The patient was placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, and azithromycin as well as intravenous fluids to treat a possible unknown infective source while awaiting cultures and further investigation. It was initially thought that a respiratory or abdominal source was the possible infective foci, which guided the selection of antibiotics.\nThe infectious disease team suspected an intrabdominal or lung infective etiology. An initial differential by the infectious diseases specialists, aside from infection, also included lymphoma and autoimmune processes such as sarcoidosis. The pulmonology team later advised that there was no evidence of pneumonia or tracheobronchitis. The hematology team emphasized the need to rule out lymphoma. Blood cultures, sputum cultures, and urine cultures were all negative. Antibiotics were initially tapered to ceftriaxone and metronidazole and then completely discontinued on day six. Drainage of the abdominal cyst revealed 250 mL of pale straw-colored serous fluid. Fluid chemistries were negative for an infectious or malignant etiology.\nThe patient underwent extensive investigation. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, serum creatine kinase levels, serum HIV tests, rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test, an acute hepatitis panel, three acid-fast sputum stains, QuantiFERON\u00ae-TB Gold test, anti-SS-A antibody levels, anti-SS-B antibody levels, and urinalysis were all normal. She did, however, test positive for an antinuclear antibody (ANA) speckled+ pattern. The ANA titer was 1:320. The double-stranded DNA antibody levels were within the normal range at 49 Iu/ml (<200 Iu/ml). A bone marrow biopsy of the iliac crest showed no evidence of malignancy or acid-fast bacilli.\nSurgery was consulted for an excisional lymph node biopsy of the left axillary lymph node. The sample was a solid tan nodular-appearing tissue measuring 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. Biopsy revealed numerous non-caseating epithelioid granulomas present in the lymphoid tissue. Stains were negative for acid-fast bacilli and fungus. The biopsy results were consistent with sarcoidosis. Flow cytometry later showed no evidence of B or T cell lymphoma.\nA tentative diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made. The granulomatous disease is seen only in sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, or fungal infections. The non-caseating granulomatous disease in the lymph nodes pointed most closely to sarcoidosis. The pulmonologist considered this to be a case of extrapulmonary sarcoidosis because only hilar nodes were involved without any lung parenchymal involvement. It was thought conceivable that the ANA elevation may have been related to sarcoidosis, although we agreed to continue to monitor the patient for other collagen vascular diseases.\nDuring the hospitalization, the patient had daily high-grade fevers. The fevers were intermittent, daily, variable, and went from 38.4 to a high of 39.4 \u00b0C. The patient was also seen by ophthalmology, and she was diagnosed with blepharitis. No uveitis or episcleritis was noted. She was treated with eye drops containing steroids, antimicrobials, and artificial tears. She was started on prednisone 40 mg PO daily with outpatient follow-up.

Her blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg, pulse rate was 108/min, temperature was 36.8 degree Celsius, and random blood sugar level was 112 mg/dL. Two months prior to presenting to us, she started experiencing recurrent episodes of vague abdominal pain, which would last for several minutes to hours and resolve spontaneously. Two weeks earlier, she had a similar episode associated with acute urinary retention, for which she was treated with injection furosemide, injection amikacin, injection pantoprazole, and laxative elsewhere.\nEvaluation in our hospital revealed anemia with hemoglobin of 9.2 g%, total white blood count of 10,300 cells/cu.mm, differential count showing 85% polymorphs, 13% lymphocytes, 2% eosinophils, and platelet count of 3.12 lakh cells/cu.mm. Peripheral smear study revealed normochromic normocytic anemia. Urinalysis was unremarkable. Her blood urea was 17 mg/dL and serum creatinine-1.1 mg/dL. Serum electrolytes showed presence of hyponatremia (Sodium = 103 mEq/dL) and hypokalemia (Potassium = 3.0 mEq/dL). Her magnesium was 3.9 mg/dL and phosphorus was 4.1 mg/dL. Initial computed tomography imaging of the brain was unremarkable.\nShe was euvolemic, and in view of acute severe symptomatic hyponatremia and hypokalemia, she was treated with intravenous 3% saline and potassium infusion.

After 3 days of treatment, she recovered without any neurological deficit and her sodium and potassium levels gradually became normal.\nTwo days later, she developed status epilepticus again. Her electrolytes revealed sodium of 111 mEq/dL and potassium of 2.3 mEq/dL. She was again initiated on intravenous 3% saline and potassium supplements. She recovered without any neurological deficit. Her repeat urinalysis was normal.\nMagnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity in the right frontal lobe and subcortical U-fibers, in which case, the differentials thought of were posterior reversible encephalopathy, extra pontine myelinolysis, and post-ictal changes. However, in the absence of an acute rise in blood pressure and renal failure, posterior reversible encephalopathy was unlikely.\nShe was clinically euvolemic.

Ultrasonogram of the abdomen revealed sludge in the gall bladder, normal-sized kidneys, normal pelvicalyceal system, and a normal urinary bladder. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed multiple tiny gall stones. Serum Amylase (275.9 U/L) and lipase (486.4 U/L) were elevated. During this episode of acute abdomen, her urine was noticed to have a reddish hue, which did not further change color on standing. Repeat urinalysis did not show any active sediments.\nFor the management of symptomatic gallstones, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was contemplated. Meanwhile, she again presented with acute abdominal pain and was treated with opioids. During this episode, her urine was noticed to be of port-wine color, which aroused a strong suspicion of porphyria. Hence we proceeded with the screening test for porphyria, i.e, the Watson Schwartz method which turned out to be positive [Figures and ] Also examination under ultraviolet lamp showed pink fluorescence at 410 nm. A 24-h urinary assay for porphobilinogen (PBG) and aminolevulinic acid (ALA) was done and they turned out to be normal, probably because it was done after the acute episode had subsided. However, with a strong suspicion of porphyria, analysis of the hydroxymethybilane synthase (HMBS) gene encoding HMBS was done using targeted next-generation sequencing. It revealed a heterozygous missense variant in exon 13 of the HMBS gene on chromosome 11 that resulted in the amino acid substitution of arginine for glycine at codon 280 (chr11:g. 118963657G>A; Depth of coverage: 60\u00d7) (p.Gly280Arg; ENST00000278715.3). The observed variant lies in the porphobilinogen deaminase and C-terminal domain of the HMBS protein and has previously been reported in a patient affected with acute intermittent porphyria, thus confirming the diagnosis in our patient.[] She was started on intravenous glucose following which she became better. Anticonvulsants were stopped. She was advised high carbohydrate diet with added salt, lifelong.

Laboratory tests revealed pancytopenia, and complete blood count findings were leukocytes 160/mm3, absolute neutrophil count 40/mm3, hemoglobin 9.4 g/dL, and platelet count 8,000/mm3. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (piperacilin/tazobactam and isepacin) were immediately administered after obtaining blood and urine for culture studies.\nAfter two days of antibiotic treatment, mild tenderness and swelling (without heating sensation) were detected on the right elbow.

Her symptoms, which had developed over the last four months, consisted of unrelenting lower abdominal pain that began 30 minutes after eating and lasted for about three hours. It was unrelieved by bowel movements or changes in position. For this reason, the patient reduced her food intake, and her weight decreased by 5 kg. The day before admission, bloody diarrhea developed.\nThe patient had a history of arterial hypertension, hiatal hernia, bilateral hearing loss due to chronic otomastoiditis, and polyarthritis (cervical, dorsal, and lumbosacral spondylosis; bilateral osteoarthritis of the hip). She had undergone open surgical cholecystectomy for gallstones in 1959. In 1998, she was hospitalized for rectal bleeding caused by acute diverticulitis. In 2004, she was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the papilla of Vater and had a cephalic pancreaticoduodenectomy. The pathological examination revealed a moderately differentiated intestinal-type adenocarcinoma measuring 1.5 cm in diameter that had invaded the muscle layers of the duodenal wall. The margins were tumor-free, and two lymph nodes were negative for malignancy. During that hospitalization, she developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that was converted to a normal sinus rhythm with amiodarone. Her medications included zofenopril (7.5 mg/day), manidipine (10 mg/day), esomeprazole 20 mg/day, celecoxib (400-600 mg/day), and acetaminophen plus codeine (500 mg plus 30 mg/day). She had no known drug allergies.\nDuring admission, she was alert and oriented with normal vital signs (blood pressure, 150/70 mm Hg; heart rate, 80 beats per minute; temperature, 36.8\u00b0C). The lower abdomen was tender, but there were no signs of peritonitis. Although the bowel sounds were decreased, passage of flatus and feces was normal. There was no palpable organomegaly. The patient's lungs were clear on auscultation and a systolic ejection murmur (2/6) was heard over her aortic area. Admission laboratory tests revealed: hemoglobin 12.1 g/dl; white-cell count 15,290/mm3 (neutrophils 86%); platelet count 317,000/mm3; total protein 5.6 g/dl; albumin 3.2 g/dl. Serum electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, gamma glutamyl transferase, and amylase levels were within normal limits, as were the prothrombin and partial thromboplastin time. Plain films of the abdomen revealed no free intraperitoneal air or air-fluid levels, and the chest x-ray excluded the presence of pneumonia or nodules. Immediately after admission she was placed on an NPO (nil per os) regimen with total parenteral nutrition, and within eight hours her symptoms completely disappeared.\nAbdominal CT (Figure ) revealed a hypodense mass measuring 4 \u00d7 4 cm in the space between the vena cava and the aorta, at the level of the origin of the celiac trunk. The mass extended caudally for about 4 cm, enveloping the origin of the superior mesenteric artery, the left renal vein at its confluence into the inferior vena cava, and the origin of the right renal artery, and anteriorly to the confluence of the splenic and mesenteric veins. Enlarged lymph nodes (1 cm) were observed at the hepatic hilum and in the intercavoaortic and left para-aortic spaces. Thickened bowel loops were also seen. This picture was consistent with local recurrence of the neoplastic disease.\nA week later, oral feedings were resumed and the patient once again experienced diffuse abdominal pain and diarrhea. The pain responded poorly to conventional analgesics (scopolamine 20 mg IV, acetaminophen 500 mg PO, tramadol 37.5 mg PO t.i.d., fentanyl 25 \u03bcg transdermally), but it disappeared promptly when oral feedings were withdrawn.\nA duplex ultrasound examination was performed to assess the mesenteric circulation (Figure and Figure ). To the extent that it could be explored, the artery showed no evident stenoses on B-mode or color- and power-Doppler evaluation. The superior mesenteric artery was characterized by a high peak systolic velocity (283 cm/sec) that was consistent with vascular stenosis. Blood flow in the celiac artery was turbulent, and the peak systolic velocity was also high (118 cm/sec). The patient was started on subcutaneous enoxaparin (4000 U/day) and transdermal nitroglycerin (10 mg/day, from 08.00 to 20.00). Since oral feedings could not be resumed, a central venous catheter was inserted for prolonged parenteral nutrition.\nIn view of the tumor histotype and the age and general condition of the patient, there was no indication for systemic chemotherapy and the patient was transferred to a hospice.

On physical examination, she was only able to speak in two-word sentences. There were bilateral coarse crackles all over the chest. She did not have any focal neurological deficits. Cardiovascular examination did not reveal abnormal heart sounds. Abdominal examination was unremarkable. The patient was immediately placed on a nonrebreather mask. However, the patient kept taking off her nonrebreather mask, continued to have worsening hypoxia, and eventually required tracheal intubation. Chest radiograph showed right upper lobe pneumonia (Figure ).\nShe was started on vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam and levofloxacin, and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Broad spectrum antibiotic therapy was chosen due to patient's critical condition and unclear etiology of the infecting pathogen.

The patient was then started on norepinephrine infusion and vasopressin infusion for blood pressure support. She then developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Her hypoxia became refractory to conventional ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was considered. She had a transesophageal echocardiogram which showed severe biventricular systolic dysfunction, global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction (EF) of 5%. Her cardiomyopathy was felt to be acute and related to sepsis. She was managed for septic and cardiogenic shock, and venous-arterial ECMO was started. She was also started on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for hypervolemia refractory to diuresis, inotropic and vasopressor support. A follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) five days later showed that the EF recovered to 45%. She continued to remain intubated for 16 days and a repeat CT chest showed worsening and multiple cavitary lesions in the right lung (Figures , ).\nA repeat TTE showed EF of 60% and normal left and right heart function. ECMO was stopped and she was decannulated on day 9, CRRT was stopped on day 9. Unfortunately, she did not tolerate withdrawal of ECMO and continued to deteriorate and became difficult to wean from the ventilator. Given her lack of response to vancomycin, she was switched to daptomycin and linezolid, and the vancomycin was discontinued. She did not improve with new antibiotic regimen, continued to accumulate volume, and could not tolerate being off CRRT that was resumed for volume removal. Her hypoxia continued to be refractory despite all efforts. The family eventually decided to transition to comfort care due to her poor prognosis.", "Question": "What is the patient\u2019s score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?", "LLM Answer": "0", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "1.5", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The Well's score for pulmonary embolism is currently 0.\nClinical signs and symptoms of DVT are repoted to be absent and so the total score remains unchanged, keeping the total score at 0.

He had no specific medical or surgical history, except for a 5-year history of type 2 diabetes treated with insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 120/70 mm Hg, temperature of 38.4\u2103, heart rate of 76 beats/min, and respiration rate of 20 breaths/min. His breathing sound was clear, and his heartbeat was regular without murmurs. However, knocking tenderness in his left flank area was noted. The initial laboratory data revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 14,680/mm3, hemoglobin level of 12.2 g/dL, platelet count of 373,000/mm3, CRP level of >12 mg/dL, and hemoglobin A1c level of 12.5%, indicating that his diabetes was poorly controlled. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, alanine transaminase, and aspartate transaminase levels were within the normal range. Urinalysis showed white and red blood cell counts of 3\u20135/high-power field (HPF) and 10\u201315/HPF, respectively. Contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans showed a multifocal decreased perfusion defect of the left kidney. Blood and urine culture samples were obtained, and intravenous ceftriaxone (2 g/d) was administered immediately. His fever subsided within 72 hours, and laboratory data demonstrated improvement. Five days after admission, the initial urine and blood cultures revealed growth of methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). Urologic evaluation regarding bladder obstruction and screening for metastatic infection were recommended. However, the patient declined further evaluation, as his discomfort had subsided, and his poor socioeconomic status impeded the payment of additional medical costs. Eight days after admission, laboratory data demonstrated further improvement (WBC count, 8,760/mm3; CRP level, 1.95 mg/dL). Follow-up urine and blood cultures obtained on day 5 revealed no bacterial growth. The patient was therefore discharged with oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg every 12 hours) for 7 days. He was asked to attend the outpatient clinic for 1 month to receive maintenance ciprofloxacin, but he failed to attend.\nApproximately 1 month later, the patient presented with a 7-day history of symptoms consistent with those at his initial visit.

Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, alanine transaminase, and aspartate transaminase levels were within the normal range. Urinalysis showed a WBC count of 30\u201350/HPF with many bacteria and a red blood cell count of 5\u201310/HPF. A CT scan showed a multifocal decreased perfusion defect of both kidneys () with bladder distension. Urologic evaluation demonstrated a residual urine volume of 250 mL. Prostate-specific antigen levels were normal. He was therefore diagnosed with recurrent pyelonephritis and neurogenic bladder. An oral alpha blocking agent and intravenous ciprofloxacin (400 mg every 12 hours) were administered. Two days after readmission, his left lower flank pain persisted, despite a fentanyl patch (12 \u00b5g/h). Although there were no neurologic deficits, a neurosurgeon was consulted regarding his severe pain and the possibility of concomitant spinal disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium enhancement was performed, revealing epidural abscesses at L4\u20135 and paraspinal abscesses of the muscles at L3\u2013S2 (). Ultrasound-guided aspiration of the paraspinal muscle layer was performed using an 18-gauge needle, and approximately 10 mL of yellow-white mucoid fluid was aspirated. The epidural abscesses were not drained, as there were no neurologic deficits. Cultures of blood and drained fluid revealed MSSA growth () with antimicrobial sensitivity identical to that of the initial culture. Urine cultures revealed growth of <1,000 colony forming units/mL, although the bacterial strain could not be identified. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed no evidence of infective endocarditis. Nafcillin was injected every 4 hours for 22 days. However, neutropenia occurred, and nafcillin was replaced with vancomycin for an additional 30 days. On day 57 after readmission, MRI showed the abscesses had decreased in size (). Residual urine volume was 40 mL, and no discomfort was observed. Laboratory data were nearly within the normal range (WBC count, 6,490/mm3; CRP level, 0.35 mg/dL).

The x-ray showed a mediastinal mass overlapping the aortic arch region (Fig. ). For verification a computed tomography (CT) was performed and revealed incidentally a type B dissection, which was most likely chronic without information of the index date, originating from an aneurysm of a left cervical arch with a maximum diameter of 6 cm (Fig. ). The left renal artery, the coeliac trunc and the main part of the superior mesenteric artery branched from the false lumen without a sign of malperfusion of the organs. Because of the huge diameter and the potential risk of rupture, an urgent surgical repair was planned. Before intervention the patient got a blood pressure adjustment by ACE inhibitor. Betablocker was not necessary because of a resting pulse under 60 beats per minute. For neurological online monitoring, sensitive and motor evoked potentials were monitored. Spinal drainage was installed 1 day before the procedure. Surgical access was carried out through median sternotomy and an additional left lateral thoracic incision through the fourth intercostal space (Hemi-Clemshell). Simultaneously to the preparation of the aneurysm, partial cardiopulmonary bypass was installed in the left groin by cannulation of the femoral artery and vein under echocardiographic guidance. During selective ventilation of the right side, the left lung was mobilized by transsection of the Ligamentum pulmonale and preparation of the perianeurysmatic tissue and adhesions. After identification and preparation of the recurrent and phrenic nerve and the supraaortal branches, the descending aorta was clamped and a distal anastomosis performed with a straight graft (20 mm). The visceral arteries partially branched from the false and true lumen without a sign of malperfusion. Before the final distal anastomosis, we performed a fenestration of the dissection membrane about a length of 5 cm to keep the perfusion of both lumina. The left carotid artery originated from the aortic arch with a distance of only 1 cm from the aneurysm. The left axillary artery branched directly from the aneurysm and was dissected and reimplanted with a separate 8 mm sidegraft to the 20 mm straight graft between the distal arch and proximal descending aorta.

She had no significant past medical history and was not on any regular medications. Her most recent travel had been to Spain a few months previously, and she lived at home with her husband and dog, who were in good health. Her GP performed some blood tests, shown in , which prompted urgent referral for admission to hospital due to the notably raised white cell count and CRP.\nIn the Emergency Department the patient was pyrexic with a temperature of 39.4 \u00b0C. Otherwise, her observations were normal. She had no audible murmurs and the rest of her examination was unremarkable.\nChest X-ray was normal and ECG showed sinus rhythm with a rate of 76 beats per minute and first-degree AV block. One set of blood cultures and urine cultures were sent and she was started on IV piperacillin/tazobactam for pyrexia of unknown origin. She was tested for influenza by PCR of a nasopharyngeal swab, which was negative.\nTransthoracic echocardiography (TTE), carried out on day 2 of admission, demonstrated a mass on the aortic valve, which was further characterized by trans-oesophageal echocardiography (TOE), identifying a 1.8\u00d70.9 cm mass with thickening of the aortic root, suspicious for root abscess.\nOn day 2 of admission, when the TTE raised the suspicion of endocarditis, she had seven further sets of blood cultures sent over a period of 72 h and was changed to IV amoxicillin 2 g 4 hourly, and gentamicin 3 mg kg\u22121 OD, as empirical treatment for native valve infective endocarditis.\nShe was transferred to cardiac surgery on day 4 of admission and underwent aortic valve replacement surgery (). Procedure note from Cardiothoracics as follows: \u2018Via oblique aortotomy, tri-leaflet valve was seen with a huge vegetation and perforation at the annulus. There was a small abscess cavity in the annulus at the non-coronary cusp. The native valve was excised, and the cavity was debrided easily, with rifampicin washout. A size 21 Inspiris Reslia bioprosthetic valve was implanted in annular position with 15\u00d7 Ethibond 2/0 interrupted technique (5 Teflon pledgeted at the Non coronary cusp area). Aorta closed in single layer, using Haemoseal pledgeted sutures. De-aired. Cross-clamp off. Right Ventricular pacing wire inserted and checked. Weaned off Cardio-Pulmonary Bypass. Good valve function with no paravalvular leak and adequate de-airing confirmed on Trans-oesophageal ECHO. Mediastinal and pericardial drains inserted. Protamine given, haemostasis checked/effected.\u2019\nThe valve was sent by the cardiac surgeons to the microbiology laboratory for culture, and sent away for 16s PCR testing. It was not sent to histopathology.\nOn day 5 of admission, the aerobic bottle of the first set of blood cultures taken flagged positive after being incubated in Bact T/Alert 3-D (bioM\u00e9rieux, France) for 3.5 days. Gram-negative rods were observed on Gram stain (). Given this information, the patient\u2019s antibiotics were changed to ceftriaxone, vancomycin and gentamicin, whilst waiting for culture and identification of this organism. Subculture on Columbia blood agar yielded fine smooth, creamy white and non-haemolytic colonies. Species identification was performed using Vitek MS [matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)], which confirmed the organism as C. carnimorsus. As there were no recommended European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) antibiotic breakpoints, E-test strips were set up and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were measured against EUCAST PK-PD (non-species-related) breakpoints. This organism was susceptible to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, penicillin, ciprofloxacin and meropenem. The remaining sets of blood cultures were all negative after 5 days of incubation.\nGiven the identification of this organism, the patient\u2019s antibiotic therapy was changed to Meropenem, Vancomycin and Gentamicin pending susceptibility testing. The heart valve was cultured and was negative after 7 days of incubation in enrichment broth. The valve was also sent to the Public Health England reference laboratory for 16S rDNA real-time PCR identification.

His laboratory testing showed elevated serum creatinine 3.42 mg/dL and urea 165 mg/dL. However, urine analysis was once again normal (1-2 erythrocytes and 0\u20132 leukocytes, no casts, and no abnormal erythrocytes) and proteinuria was at 800 mg/24 h. A renal ultrasound showed slightly enlarged kidneys (right, 11.5 cm and left, 12.4 cm) with increased width of cortex (1.5 cm and 2.6 cm). Although the diagnosis of pulmonary and renal failure were evident, due to the absence of nephritic syndrome and the very short period of renal function decline, the diagnosis of RPGN and, therefore, Goodpasture syndrome of any cause could not be supported. Further, the patient had no clinical or radiology signs of lung haemorrhage. At this point the differential diagnosis for his acute kidney injury (AKI) included prerenal AKI due to decrease in renal blood supply at his previous hospitalization (not supported by the referral letter information) and renal AKI due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) induced by drug agents or AIN caused by drugs or microbial agents. For these reasons the pulse methylprednisolone treatment was stopped when 3 gr in total was reached and followed by oral methylprednisolone at a dose of 48 mg daily with fast tapering. Piperacillin-tazobactam was stopped at Day 9 as it is an agent that could cause ATN or AIN. The patient was supported with conservative measures (including diuretics), with respiratory symptoms, signs, and BP normalizing over the next 2-3 days and his peripheral edema gradually resolving. Over the next days serum immunology testing (IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, C4, ANA, ANCA, anti-dsDNA, anti-GBM, rheumatoid factor, cryoglobulins, serum protein electrophoresis, and immunoglobulin-free \u03ba/\u03bb chains) was negative, confirming the differential diagnosis.\nWith the patient at stable condition, renal function slightly improved but reached a plateau between Day 10 and Day 12 (serum creatinine 3.52, urea 188 mg/dL). On this basis, moxifloxacin was also interrupted at Day 13, as it could also be a causative factor for AIN, and an ultrasound guided biopsy was performed to diagnose AKI of renal origin at Day 15. Light microscopy showed evidence of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis with interstitial edema and inflammatory peritubular infiltrations composed mainly of lymphocytes. The glomeruli had evidence of nonspecific mild mesangial enlargement, with no abnormalities of the glomerular basement membrane (). Immunofluorescence showed no evidence of immune deposits. On this basis further testing for Hantaan virus and Legionella pneumophila antigen was ordered, while a more detailed record of the patient's history revealed that the patient had recently worked for two nights as a cook in his hotel, which opened only for a weekend over the holiday season. On this basis, the diagnosis of AIN due to Legionella pneumophila was confirmed by a positive antigen test at the urine sample returning at Day 21.\nAfter the biopsy the patient was in a stable condition, with his renal function progressively improving with oral steroid use tapered to a dose of 4 mg per week. He was discharged from our hospital at Day 22 with his serum creatinine at 1.87 mg/dL at 28 mg methylprednisolone daily (). He was closely followed up in the Outpatient Department with serum creatinine at 1.53 mg/dL at 1 month after discharge and returned to normal (0.88 mg/dL) at two months after discharge () with cessation of steroid treatment.", "Question": "Using the MDRD GFR equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2?", "LLM Answer": "39.5", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "38.256", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient is 51 years old.

She denied any fevers, night sweats, weight changes, or urinary complaints. Her past medical history was significant for chronic paranoid schizophrenia, cocaine abuse, and HIV infection. She was not on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) at the time of admission. Her vital signs included a heart rate of 120 beats/min and a blood pressure of 160/110 mmHg. Physical examination was remarkable for the presence of coarse crackles at the lung bases, periorbital and lower extremity edema, and mild abdominal distension. Laboratory studies revealed an elevated serum creatinine of 14.6 mg/dL, an elevated serum urea nitrogen of 86 mg/dL, and an elevated serum potassium of 6.9 mmol/L. Of significance, her renal function 4 months prior to this admission was normal with a creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL at that time. Urinalysis showed 2000 mg of protein per dL and urine microscopy revealed 6 red blood cells per high-power field and 22 white blood cells per high-power field but no dysmorphic red blood cells or casts. Other abnormal laboratory values on admission included a low serum albumin of 1.8 g/dL and a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 33.7 consistent with nephrotic range proteinuria. An ultrasound revealed enlarged kidneys with diffuse increased echogenicity and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis without contrast revealed bilateral enlarged and edematous kidneys, scattered abdominal and pelvic ascites, and moderate soft tissue anasarca ().\nDuring the course of admission, the patient became tachypneic, had worsening oxygen saturations, and had to be intubated and mechanically ventilated for respiratory distress. Hemodialysis was emergently implemented after she became anuric and her renal function continued to deteriorate.\nThe patient's CD4 count at the time of admission was 350 cells/ul with a HIV RNA viral load of 1,790,000 copies/mL. Given the finding of nephrotic range proteinuria accompanied by a precipitous decline in renal function, a presumptive diagnosis of HIVAN was made and a serological workup was initiated to exclude other possible underlying etiologies. Serum protein electrophoresis, urine protein electrophoresis, anti-nuclear antibody, anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody, anti-streptolysin O, hepatitis serology, serum cryoglobulins, complement levels (C3, C4), and rapid plasma reagin tests were all negative. Her HbA1C was within normal limits at 5.8%. Serum testing was negative for cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (C-ANCA) and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (P-ANCA). However, the serum was positive for anti-glomerular basement antibody (anti-GBM Ab) with a value of 91 units (normal: 0\u201320 units).\nAlthough chest CT and bronchoscopy did not reveal diffuse alveolar hemorrhage that can be seen in anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease, the finding of an elevated anti-GBM antibody precluded a definitive diagnosis of HIVAN based on clinical context alone. A decision was therefore made to perform a CT-guided renal biopsy at this point.\nLight microscopy of the renal cortical tissue showed marked diffuse tubular degenerative and regenerative changes with interstitial fibrosis, focal microcystic tubular dilatation, and hyaline casts (Figures , , and ). Electron microscopy showed glomerular basement membrane thickening without disruption or electron dense deposits. Endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions most consistent with HIVAN were also visualized (Figures , , and ). The glomeruli showed focal segmental sclerosis with no evidence of crescentic glomerulonephritis and immunofluorescence revealed no specific immunoglobulin or complement deposits (). Based on these pathologic findings, the final diagnosis was therefore HIVAN.\nThe patient continued to improve clinically and biochemically while receiving hemodialysis three times a week. She was eventually weaned from the ventilator and extubated. However, due to the patient's persistent dependence on hemodialysis throughout admission, it was concluded that the patient had end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and that she would require lifelong hemodialysis.

At the initial presentation, the patient had a body temperature of 40.2 \u00b0C, blood pressure of 183/81 mmHg, and pulse of 74 beats per min. Hypoxemia was not confirmed. The physical examination was unremarkable. Chest X-ray and urine test were normal. Laboratory tests revealed an elevation of blood urea nitrogen 23.8 mg/dl, creatinine 1.14 mg/dl and C-reactive protein 1.93 mg/dl. Platelet count was low at 105,000/\u03bcl. White cell count, hemoglobin and liver function tests were within normal range as shown in supplementary file. Two sets of blood cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, mycobacteria and fungi were drawn. Then, the patient was started empirically on meropenem and teicoplanin for broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. In addition to blood cultures, a urinalysis with culture and a chest X-ray and CT were performed and found to be normal. The patient had no clinically evident sites of infection by history or physical examination. On day 2, a coryneform organism was recovered for 32 h by BACTEC (BD, Tokyo, Japan) from both the aerobic and anaerobic tubes of all blood cultures. Brevibacterium species were identified by Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The score value was 2.36. On gram-stained smears from the culture plates, the organisms appeared as Gram-positive, club-shaped, slightly curved rods, and some coccal forms were present (Fig. a).

Casein hydrolysis test was performed as follows. 1) inoculate the organism on a skim milk agar, 2) incubate the plate at 37 \u00b0C, 3) examine the plate for zone of hydrolysis following incubation. Both the organism and JCM 11567T showed a lack of hydrolysis of casein, while a hydrolysis of casein was confirmed in JCM 2594T as shown in Fig. . The organism had an absence of pyrazinamidase, while JCM 2594T showed a presence of pyrazinamidase. Additional microbiological tests by API 50CH showed that utilization of D-arabinose and gluconate was negative. These results were consistent with the organism as B. paucivorans.

Laboratory examination on admission showed serum total bilirubin level of 9.6 mg/dl. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging revealed Bismuth-Corlette type IIIB perihilar cholangiocarcinoma with left portal vein and left hepatic artery invasion, type III portal vein variation, dilated right intrahepatic bile duct, and left liver lobe atrophy (). Due to the unique location of the gallbladder and combined multiple hepatic anomalies, presence of LSGB was highly suspected (). The branching pattern of the portal vein appeared strange compared with the usual type III portal vein variation, in which the liver appeared to be divided into 3 parts; the right posterior section, the right anterior section integrated with the left medial section, and the left lateral section (). For biliary decompression, endoscopic nasobiliary drainage was performed following endoscopic retrograde cholangiography. Surgery was performed when the serum total bilirubin level was 1.7 mg/dl.\nAfter dissection of the hilar structures, we recognized that the tumor was located at the imaginary hilar bile duct bifurcation, but its actual location was corresponding to the biliary confluence of the left median and lateral sections. After transecting the distal bile duct at the level of the pancreas, we found that there was no vascular invasion of the right-sided liver. Thus, the extent of liver resection included extended left lateral sectionectomy (, ). Through the anterior transection approach without the hanging maneuver, the liver was transected and the bile duct was resected en bloc. The right-sided bile duct orifice in the liver was 8 mm in size and single, and probing exploration revealed that it was the common-channel bile duct confluence of the above-mentioned three sections in the right-sided liver. The resection margin was tumor-negative on frozen-section biopsy. Since only the left-sided wall of the umbilical portion of the portal vein was partially invaded by the tumor, the involved portion was excised and then covered with a remnant branch patch after excision of a small adjacent portal vein branch in the left medial section ().\nThe caudate duct did not appear to be involved based on the preoperative imaging study findings, but the Spigelian lobe with the paracaval portion was excised to achieve maximal curability according to the general concept of surgical resection for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma. One 5-mm-sized bile duct opening was exposed following caudate lobe resection, but it was directly communicating with the right-sided duct; therefore, it was closed because bilio-enteric reconstruction was not necessary. Locoregional lymph nodes were dissected from the hepatic hilum to the celiac axis because some nodes were tumor-positive on frozen-section biopsy. Biliary reconstruction was performed through a single, large hepaticojejunostomy using a Roux-en-Y limb.\nPathological examination revealed that the final diagnosis was moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma involving the liver with vascular invasion of the left hepatic artery and left portal vein, concurrent perineural invasion without lymphovascular invasion, and lymph node metastasis in 5 out of 12 nodes ().

The serum tests showed normal liver function and moderately impaired renal function (creatinine 10\u201315, urea > 200).\nShe had a complex medical history including obstructive sleep apnoea, asthma, glaucoma, hypothyroidism, hypertensive cardiomyopathy and bipolar disorder; registered disabled. She also had a copper intra uterine contraceptive device in situ for the past three years. Given her body habitus (BMI 42), abdominal and pelvic examination was difficult and non-specific. The only finding of relevance was bilateral adnexal fullness.\nShe was managed within the gynaecological oncology multi disciplinary framework (MDT). On reviewing the CT films the features noted include bilateral basal pleural thickening, bilateral hydronephrosis, retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy associated with retroperitoneal fibrosis and bilateral adnexal cystic masses. There was a small volume of ascites.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed for further characterisation of the adnexal masses. The right adnexal complex cystic lesion measured 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7 cm in diameter and had a thick wall (up to 2 cm), which was irregular. There were several septations, some of which measured 3 \u2013 4 mm. There were no enhancing papillary formations, although the wall and septa enhanced. The appearance suggested an ovarian lesion with possible involvement of the Fallopian tube. The left adnexal cyst measured 5 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 4 cm, had a smooth wall and contained a single thin septation, consistent with a benign ovarian cyst. Both cysts contained fluid, which was low on T1 and high on T2, with no evidence of fat or blood. Surrounding the cysts posteriorly, the fat was streaky in appearance and there was marked thickening of the adjacent fascial planes, with thickening of the mesorectal fascia up to 1 cm. The fascial thickening extended up the pre-sacral space and along the posterior aspect of the pelvic sidewalls, resulting in the obstruction of the ureters. Enlarged lymph nodes (up to 1.8 cm in short axis) were present along both pelvic sidewalls, which were striking due to the very high T2 signal intensity (Figure ). Nodes were also seen in the inguinal and para-aortic regions. Although the imaging appearances could not rule out an ovarian neoplasm, the features noted above were suggestive of an inflammatory process. In view of the woman's medical history and clinical status the MDT recommendation was clinical review and imaging guided biopsy of lymph nodes.\nThe woman underwent CT guided right inter iliac node biopsy, following an unyielding biopsy of inguinal nodes. Histology revealed non-caseating granulomatous lymphadenitis with negative stains for acid-fast bacilli and fungi. There was no foreign body seen. Given the histological findings our attention was directed towards an inflammatory process. She was subsequently referred to respiratory physicians, with a working diagnosis of sarcoidosis. She was also referred to urologists for the management of retroperitoneal fibrosis and bilateral hydronephrosis. Abdominal pain prompted insertion of bilateral JJ ureteric stents. The physicians initiated a (step-down) course of prednisolone. Symptomatic improvement was observed but the renal function did not change. Repeat imaging demonstrated resolution of hydronephrosis.\nThe woman was reviewed again clinically after the course of steroids. During this interval the physicians ordered an autoantibody screen as autoimmune disease can co-exist with sarcoidosis; the screen was negative (Rheumatoid factor, anti-DNA antibody and antinuclear antibody). On examination there was no evidence of any palpable lymphadenopathy. An ultra sonographic examination six months later demonstrated a bulky uterus and reduction in the size of the right adnexal cyst. Repeat imaging (MRI axial T2W image) a further two months later demonstrated resolution of the left adnexal cyst. There was a small residual cyst on the right and marked decrease in the thickening of the mesorectal fascia. The lymph nodes appeared normal (Fig ). The retroperitoneal fibrosis on imaging had resolved. Her CA125 remained normal.

Her only medical history was cutaneous lupus treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate for 8 years. Physical examination found dyspnea, edema limited to the lower extremities and superior vena cava syndrome. Laboratory tests confirmed hypoxemia with PaO2 at 70 mmHg; and normal renal function (creatinine: 0.97 mg/dL). A computed tomography (CT) scan found normal pulmonary parenchyma and vascularization, but revealed the presence of an anterior mediastinal mass. A PET scan confirmed positive metabolic activity of the mediastinal mass (Fig. A). A biopsy was performed under mediastinoscopy. Pathological examination of the mass revealed the presence of pseudo-epithelial tumor cells of the thymus, while the thymic cortex was normal, without lymphocyte infiltration in the tumor tissue. These features led to a diagnosis of type A non-invasive thymoma (Fig. B).\nWhile investigations on the mediastinal mass were being performed, the patient developed acute kidney injury (Creatinine 4.7 mg/dL), with nephrotic syndrome: serum albumin was 9.7 g/L, proteinuria was 17 g/g (composed of more than 80% of albumin) and microscopic hematuria was positive. In agreement with the nephrotic syndrome, a high level of cholesterol (total cholesterol = 3.07 g/l triglycerides = 1.19 g/l, LDL = 2.13 g/l), and lower levels of serum immunoglobulins (IgG 2.58 g/l, IgA 1.73 g/l, IgM 2.5 g/l) were also found. Results of the renal biopsy were as follows: normal kidney parenchyma on optical microscopy and immuno-fluorescence analysis without any proliferation or deposition. Electronic microscopy showed extensive foot process effacement corresponding to a loss of cell differentiation, loss of pedicels and increased collagen matrix production, creating a gap between the podocyte and glomerular basement membrane (Fig. D). No podocyte detachment was observed and there was no evidence in favour of a diagnosis of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Regarding immunologic tests, anti-nucleic antibodies were positive (1/160), but Extractable Nuclear Antigen (ENA) antibodies, complement fractions C3/C4, and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. Similarly, tests for HIV, hepatitis B and C, and cryoprotein were all negative. Our final diagnosis was minimal change disease (MCD) associated with thymoma. Therefore, oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) was initiated immediately and thymectomy was performed.\nEight weeks after initiation of the steroid therapy, the patient showed a significant lack of response to steroid therapy, with serum albumin of 10 g/L, and proteinuria of 13.5 g/g, Clinical examination found exacerbation of asthenia as well as edema. Given the intensity and the persistence of nephrotic syndrome, with no improvement after steroid induction, we decided to reinforce the treatment with rituximab (1 g given twice, 15 days apart). We monitored the CD19 count (96/mm3 before administration and 0/mm3 after the second dose - this is in agreement with the profound lymphocyte depletion expected). Over the following days, we noticed a progressive improvement in both albuminemia and proteinuria. Complete remission was observed 3 weeks after infusion of rituximab. We followed French guidelines for tapering off the corticosteroids. After 11 weeks at high dose (1 mg/kg/day = 80 mg/d from 09/06/19 to 22/08/19), we pursued with 50 mg/d for 2 weeks, 35 mg/d for 2 weeks, 25 mg/d for 2 weeks, 20 mg/d for 2 weeks, 17.5 mg/d for 2 weeks, 15 mg/d for 2 weeks, 10 mg/d for 2 weeks, 7.5 mg/d for 4 weeks, 5 mg/d for 4 weeks, followed by steroid withdrawal using hydrocortisone. At the last follow-up, serum albumin was 38 g/L, proteinuria was 0.6 g/g and creatinine 0.83 mg/dL (Fig. A). The patient consented to collection of serum at different timepoints. We performed a cytokine profile using a bead assay (Legendplex human inflammation panel, Biolegend, San Diego, CA) on serum collected before (BM1, BM2 and BM3) and after treatment with rituximab (BM4). We did not find any deregulation of the cytokine profile before treatment with rituximab, either on the TH1 side (INFg, TNF, IL6, IL12) or the TH2 side (IL4, IL5, IL10, IL13). Cytokines were in the normal range, except for MCP1 and IL18, which were increased.

The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 12.0 mg Creatinine/10.0 dL = 1.2 mg Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 106.0 \u00b5mol Creatinine/L converts to 1.2 mg Creatinine/dL. \nThe patient is not Black, so the race coefficient is defaulted to 1.0.\nThe patient is male, so the gender coefficient is 1.\nThe patient's estimated GFR is calculated using the MDRD equation as:\nGFR = 175 * creatinine^(-1.154) * age^(-0.203) * race_coefficient * gender_coefficient.

He had a Waterston operation at 9 months of age and a Blalock\u2013Taussig procedure at 1 year, 10 months of age. At age 10, the patient underwent surgery to ligate the ascending aorta\u2013right pulmonary artery shunt path. He did not undergo intracardiac repair. The main pulmonary artery was completely occluded from the right ventricular outflow tract. The right-to-left shunted blood ejected from the left ventricle through the ventricular septal defect and merged with oxygenated blood via the shunt path from the left subclavian artery to the left pulmonary artery.\nRenal function decreased when the patient was 38 years of age. Home oxygen therapy at night was initiated 1 year before the patient presented at our hospital; a \u03b2-blocker (carvedilol, 2.5 mg/day) was started 6 months before presentation. The patient did not experience breathing difficulty in his daily life (New York Heart Association Class II) and was able to work. A PD catheter was inserted in April 2015. Renal function gradually decreased and exacerbation of lower leg edema was observed, so PD was started. The patient\u2019s height was 158 cm, his weight was 54 kg, his body temperature was 36.3 \u00b0C, his blood pressure was 136/69 mmHg, his pulse rate was 81 beats/min, and his oxygen saturation was 81% in room air.\nLaboratory testing was performed on admission. Urinalysis dipstick examination indicated 4+ protein (8 g/g Cr) and was negative for blood. Arterial blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.278, PaCO2 of 43 mmHg, PaO2 of 52 mmHg, bicarbonate of 19.7 mmol/L, and base excess of \u2212 6.9 mmol/L. Chest X-ray showed a cardiothoracic ratio of 63%, indicating cardiac enlargement. Abdominal ultrasonography showed mild atrophy of the bilateral kidneys, increased cortical brightness, and cysts. Left ventricular findings of cardiac ultrasonography included a left ventricular end-diastolic diameter of 44 mm, left ventricular end-systolic diameter of 28 mm, left ventricular ejection fraction of 71%, septal thickness of 26 mm, and rear wall thickness of 11 mm. The valve findings were mild aortic regurgitation, trivial mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and pulmonary artery closure. The main pulmonary artery was not visible from the right ventricular outflow tract. The ventricular septal defect was 19\u201322 mm in diameter; there was almost right-to-left shunting across the defect, with only a slight left-to-right shunt. After Waterston operation there was good flow through the shunt from the ascending aorta to the right pulmonary artery. After left Blalock\u2013Taussig shunt operation there was decreased flow velocity from the left subclavian artery to the left pulmonary artery.\nIn July 2015, PD was started. Serum creatinine (Cr) at the start of PD was 5.5 mg/dl. The fast peritoneal equilibrium test (PET) result was low average. From November 2015 (4 months after the start of PD), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) gradually increased, water removal was 200\u2013300 mL/day, and body weight increased. In March 2016 (8 months after starting PD), the PD fluid protocol was changed. In February 2017, the patient developed lower leg edema and his BNP increased to 1300 pg/mL, so treatment was changed to continuous cycling PD. With increased water removal, the edema resolved and BNP rapidly decreased. Changes associated with cyanosis included a hemoglobin level of 18\u201320 g/dL, indicating polycythemia; the patient also experienced headache. Phlebotomy treatment was performed four times. Because of concerns about iron deficiency resulting from phlebotomy, hemostasis therapy was discontinued, after which the patient\u2019s headache improved (Fig. ).\nThe serum bicarbonate level at the start of PD in July 2015 was 20 mmol/L. This value increased to 25\u201330 mmol/L with the change in PD fluid protocol, and venous blood PCO2 increased with the start of PD (Fig. ).\nThe target SpO2 was adjusted to 70\u201385%; SpO2 was unchanged after PD. SpO2 decreased with the complication of heart failure, but improved with fluid management. Periodic echocardiography showed that PD initiation had little effect on hemodynamics.\nThere were no PD-related complications.\nIn July 2019, 5 years after the start of dialysis, the patient was admitted to the hospital for treatment of abdominal pain and dyspnea. Abdominal CT revealed a diverticulum of the colon in the hepatic curvature of the transverse colon. Surgery was considered to carry a high risk of respiratory and hemodynamic breakdown in this patient. On the basis of abdominal findings and CT findings, it was concluded that conservative treatment with antibiotics and fasting was appropriate. With the consent of the family, laparotomy was not performed and conservative treatment was initiated.

The patient's oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter (SpO2) while receiving air was 75\u201389%, which was partially corrected to 91\u201398% while receiving 2 L/min of oxygen via nasal prong (VNP). Arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) under oxygen administration revealed the following: pH 7.39, arterial CO2 partial pressure (PaCO2) 44.6 mmHg, arterial O2 partial pressure(PaO2) 65.3 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3\u2013) 26.1 mEq/L.\nDuring induction, both mask ventilation and intubation were difficult (laryngeal view: Cormack-Lehane grade IV). Intubation trials with a 37-Fr. left-sided double lumen tube (DLT) (Mallinckrodt\u2122, Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) and laryngoscopy, followed by a videostylet (Optiscope\u00ae, Pacific Medical, Seoul, Korea) failed. Hence, a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) was used to intubate a single lumen tube (SLT) (ID 8.0), and then the SLT was changed to a DLT using a tube exchanger.\nLeft one-lung ventilation (OLV) was maintained with an SpO2 of 86\u201390% at an inspired oxygen fraction (FIO2) of 1.0 during right-lung lavage. We performed external percussion physiotherapy with an automatic mechanical percussion device (The Vest\u2122 Model 205 [Airway Clearance System], frequency 10 Hz, duration 3 minutes, Hill-Rom, Charleston, SC, USA) rather than manual chest percussion. After right-lung lavage, we resumed two-lung ventilation (TLV) with intermittent suction for 20 minutes (FIO2 1.0). For left-lung lavage, right OLV was started with an FIO2 of 1.0, but it was impossible to maintain SpO2 > 80% (). Therefore, we decided to postpone left-lung lavage until conditions in the right lung improved (). A chest X-ray taken after intensive care unit (ICU) transfer showed no specific findings, including pneumothorax. One day after the lavage, while in the ICU, the patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation, extubated, and transferred to the general ward.\nThree days later, the patient was returned to the operating room for left-lung lavage. The patient's SpO2 was 91\u201396% with O2 3 L/min VNP. We intubated the trachea with a SLT via Glide-Scope (Verathon Medical, British Columbia, Canada) and then changed the SLT to a DLT with a tube exchanger because the previous intubation was difficult. We confirmed breath sounds from both lungs, and right and left lung ventilation during separation through auscultation. The proper tube location was confirmed using an FOB.\nTLV was performed in volume-controlled mode: FIO2 1.0, tidal volume of 400 ml, RR of 15 rates/min, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 31 cmH2O, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. PaO2 was 57 mmHg (SpO2 86%) on ABGA examination. Fifty minutes after induction, we started right OLV in pressure-controlled mode: FIO2 1.0, inspiratory pressure of 25 cmH2O above PEEP 5 cmH2O, tidal volume of 200 ml, and RR of 20 /min. Within a few minutes of starting right OLV, the patient's SpO2 plunged below 80%, so we rapidly resumed TLV and re-confirmed the proper position of the DLT using an FOB. We did not observe any bronchial secretion or obstruction. Right OLV was tried again, but the patient's SpO2 rapidly decreased to < 80% within a few minutes. After resuming TLV, 2.5 mg of salbutamol was nebulized to relieve any bronchial constriction, and 100 mg of hydrocortisone was injected intravenously to improve symptoms. During manual ventilation, we detected very poor lung compliance. In auscultation, the patient's breath sounds from the right lung were very distant and nearly inaudible. Therefore, we suspected he had a right-side pneumothorax, which was confirmed on chest X-ray (). A chest tube was inserted by a thoracic surgeon, and a follow-up chest X-ray showed that the pneumothorax had decreased (). Two hours after induction, lung compliance and arterial oxygenation improved: FIO2 1.0, tidal volume of 450 ml, RR of 18/min, PIP of 24 cmH2O, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. PaO2 improved to 93 mmHg on the following ABGA examination ().\nWe re-tried right OLV and were finally able to maintain SpO2 > 90%: FIO2 1.0, inspiratory pressure of 23 cmH2O above PEEP 5 cmH2O, tidal volume of 320 ml, and RR of 20 /min, without any severe air leakage or tidal-volume loss. The left-lung lavage was started along with right OLV with the chest tube inserted state. During the remaining lavage period, we maintained SpO2 > 85% without further deterioration.\nAfter lavage, the patient was transferred to the ICU and received mechanical ventilation. On postoperative day (POD) 1, the patient developed a high fever (38.8\u2103) and was diagnosed as having pneumonia with parapneumonic effusion in the right lower lobe, so antibiotics were administered. The chest tube was removed on POD 3, and extubation was performed on POD 4. The patient was transferred to the general ward on POD 7 and discharged on POD 19.

A physical examination suggested that there was severe cervical spondylitis involving thoracolumbar vertebral column, without lower limb neurological involvement. No cardiovascular system abnormality was detected.\nThe airway examination showed adequate mouth opening with artificial dentures, Mallampati grade III restricted neck mobility. A preoperative assessment for difficult intubation was made.\nRadiographs of the vertebral column revealed ankylosis of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinous processes showing posterior joint involvement, resorption of the anterior surfaces of the vertebral bodies and calcification and ossification of the posterior ligaments and surrounding soft tissues.\nFollowing the traditional anesthetic approach to ankylosing patients, we decided to opt for securing the airway using awake endotracheal intubation; however, the patient did not give his consent for this. A difficult intubation cart, which had a selection of oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal airway, gum elastic bougie, fiberoptic bronchoscope, cricothyroidotomy, and other aids, was kept ready.\nOn the day of the surgery, the patient was premedicated with oral ranitidine 150 mg and diazepam 5 mg, two hours before surgery, with a sip of water, and injection glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg intramuscularly one hour before surgery. Preparation for fiberoptic intubation was done. Nasal patency was checked and the nasal cavity prepared with oxymetazoline nasal drops. In the operation room the patient was made to lie supine with the head adequately supported on three pillows and routine monitors, such as, the electrocardiogram, non-invasive blood pressure, and pulse oximeter and capnograph were placed. The IV line, with a 18 Gauge canula, was started. Anesthesia was induced with IV injection propofol 2 mg/kg, slowly, in titrated doses, with fentanyl 2 \u03bcg/kg. The anesthetist had to use a higher footstep than normal to get the desired level. We opted for fiberoptic bronchoscopy, but as the heart rate increased to 144/min and the blood pressure increased to 180/118 mmHg, we administered a further bolus dose of 50 mg of propofol to increase the depth of anesthesia. The patient's heart rate, and blood pressure stabilized, but the patient started desaturating with apneic spells, so we decided to abandon the procedure. The patient was allowed to wake up.

Clear CSF was obtained through the spinal needle and 3 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine and 25\u03bcg/kg fentanyl was injected intrathecally. Due to the spinal deformity, we were not able to achieve the appropriate position for intrathecal block. Therefore, we carried out some maneuvres; we placed a pillow beneath the left shoulder to make the spine of the scapula perpendicular to the table, and the operating table (OT) was tilted 20\u00b0 to the right, to straighten the spine and to make it parallel to the floor.\nThe block was adequate with sensory block up to T4 and adequate motor blockade upto T6.

Written informed consent for presentation was obtained from the patient and his parents.\nThe patient weighed 102 kg until four years ago, at which time, with the help of a dietitian, he started to lose weight. However, after losing 2 kg, he discontinued the dietary regime. Two years later, when he weighed 100 kg, he decided to lose weight again because he felt uncomfortable with the way he looked and felt very overweight. Within a year, he lost 20 kg by eating less and playing basketball every day for approximately two hours a day. At that time, he had to quit basketball due to a busy school schedule which led to a fear of gaining weight, causing him to restrict his diet even more. By restricting his daily intake to 500 kcal, he had lost 17.5 kg within the last two months before presenting to our clinic. The patient denied having body image problems but agreed that he had an intense fear of gaining weight. Past medical history was unremarkable except for an appendectomy performed when he was 7 years old. The family history revealed that two of his aunts have Hashimoto thyroiditis.\nAt admission, the patient\u2019s body weight was 60.7 kg (50-75th percentile).

Cardiac examination was normal except for the bradycardia, and other systems were also normal on his physical examination. Meeting the diagnostic criteria of the fourth edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV), he was diagnosed with AN-restrictive type and hospitalized due to bradycardia. His laboratory investigations which included complete blood count, liver and kidney function tests, glucose and electrolyte levels, sedimentation rate, cortisol, cholesterol levels, and urinary analysis were all within normal ranges. Thyroid function tests revealed very low TSH levels (0.025 uIU/mL, normal range: 0.27-4.20 uIU/mL), low free T3 (fT3) levels (2.87 pmol/L, normal range 3.10-6.70 pmol/L), and normal free T4 (fT4) levels (21.9 pmol/L, normal range: 12.00-22.00 pmol/L). Thyroid peroxidase antibodies and thyroglobulin antibodies were high, while TSH receptor antibodies were negative. With these findings, he was additionally diagnosed with Hashimoto thyroiditis. Thyroid ultrasonography confirmed the diagnosis.\nIn the inpatient unit, the patient was followed by an interdisciplinary team consisting of a child and adolescent psychiatrist, an adolescent medicine specialist, a pediatric endocrinologist, and a dietitian with special training and experience in adolescent EDs. During his three-week stay, he gained 4 kg. Despite the weight gain and the improvement in his nutritional status, bradycardia continued (40-50 bpm). Echocardiography findings were normal, and Holter monitoring only revealed sinus bradycardia. Thyroid functions were monitored closely without any medical treatment, along with his vitals. Before discharge, while TSH levels were still low (0.018 uIU/mL), fT3 levels were thought to be relatively high (3.76 pmol/L) considering his metabolic status. The patient was discharged with a weight of 64.7 kg. At his follow-up visit 2 months later, the boy had gained weight and weighed 75.1 kg. Due to the gradual increase noted in his TSH levels (from 8.91 to 28.84 uIU/mL), levothyroxine treatment was started. At that time, fT3 and fT4 levels were measured as 7.74 and 4.42 pmol/L, respectively. Two months later, it was learned that he had been using levothyroxine in doses three times higher than the recommended dose. Although monitored closely, due to the drug compliance problems and weight changes with severe body image issues, it was hard to maintain the thyroid levels within a stable course.

He also had other distinct skeletal features that included prominent supraciliary arches and nose bridge, as well as large hands and feet.\nFollowing induction of general anesthesia with lidocaine, fentanyl, and propofol and muscle relaxation with succinylcholine, an elective Airtraq device was used for intubation with moderate difficulty. Following a second attempt, a 7.0 endotracheal tube was passed blindly into his trachea because of large immobile epiglottis that resulted in a grade IV indirect view. His surgical procedure was uneventful and he was extubated without difficulty. After full recovery in the post-anesthesia recovery unit, he was informed that he had a difficult airway and advised to inform all future anesthesia providers. In addition, because of the high index of suspicion for acromegaly he was educated about the possibility of having this disorder and was advised to follow up with his primary care provider for further evaluation.\nEndocrine tests performed subsequently included serum cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, prolactin, hemoglobin A1C, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), GH, and parathyroid hormone levels. All of his biochemical markers were normal except for his serum IGF-1 and GH (Table ) that were 700 ng/ml and 22.5 ng/ml, respectively: twofold greater than the reference normal upper limit. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed moderate left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved systolic left ventricular function. Magnetic resonance imaging of his brain showed a large mass arising from the sella and extending into the suprasellar cistern (19 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 20 mm), consistent with pituitary macroadenoma (Fig. ).\nA neurosurgical evaluation was performed and he underwent a transsphenoidal resection of his pituitary tumor 3 months later. Given his known difficult airway, he was intubated using an awake oral fiberoptic technique. His perioperative period was uneventful. Pathological evaluation showed the resected pituitary adenoma to be focally reactive for prolactin and GH, and was negative for adrenocorticotropic hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone. Serum laboratory tests performed 3 weeks postoperatively showed normalization of his prolactin, IGF-1, and GH levels (Table ).", "Question": "Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?", "LLM Answer": "77.1", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "79.52", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient's gender is Male.\nThe patient's height is 1.85 m, which is 1.85 m * 39.3701 in/m = 72.835 in. \nFor males, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows:\nIBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60)\nPlugging in the values gives us 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (72.835 (in inches) - 60) = 79.52 kg.\nHence, the patient's IBW is 79.52 kg.", "Result": "Correct"}

Four months after the onset of numbness and motor weakness of the lower extremities, she presented to our hospital without any trauma. One week before presentation, the gait disorder and bladder and rectal disorder became apparent. The patient\u2019s history included hypertension. There was no family history of acromegaly or OPLL.\nShe weighed 72 kg, her height was 162.0 cm, and her BMI was 27.4 kg/m2. Blood pressure at admission was 160/90 mmHg. Her facial appearance was acromegaly-like, with a frontal protrusion, nose and lip enlargement, and mandibular protrusion (Fig. a). We also observed thickening of the soft tissue of the palm and fingers and thickening of the Achilles tendon. There was no history of headache, sweating, or fatigue, and we did not observe Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon or carpal tunnel syndrome.\nIn the upper extremities, no abnormal neurological findings were observed. However, weakness in both lower extremities (iliopsoas muscle MMT4, quadriceps femoris MMT4) was observed. Both lower extremity tendon reflexes were enhanced, and clonus was observed. Hypo-sensation (5/10) was observed below the umbilicus. These neurological findings suggested spinal cord lesions below the T10 level. She was barely able to walk on flat ground using two canes, and the Japanese Orthopedic Association score was 9 points (4\u20131\u20132-0-0-2).\nThe complete blood count was normal. An evaluation of glycemic status revealed a fasting plasma glucose level of 115 mg/dL. The glycosylated hemoglobin level was 5.9%, and the plasma glucose level during the OGTT (75 g glucose) at 2 h was 153 mg/dL. These results ruled out type 2 diabetes. Hepatic function tests and renal function tests revealed no abnormalities except for high alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (432 IU/L). Estimations of serum electrolytes, including sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphorous were within normal limits. Hormonal evaluation showed raised serum IGF-1 (1914 ng/mL, reference range by age for IGF-I levels is 83 ~ 221 ng/mL) and GH (80.3 ng/mL) levels. GH was not suppressed with 75 g glucose loading, (after 60 min: 131 ng/mL; after 120 min: 46.9 ng/mL).\nX-ray images showed characteristic findings of acromegaly. Scalloping in some vertebrae was observed, as indicated by arrowheads on a lateral view of the lumbar X-ray in Fig. a []. On thoracic spine X-ray there were no findings of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) such as more than three successive bone bridges, and there were no anterior or posterior osteophytes with a biconcave appearance such as Erdheim spondylosis in the thoracic spine (Fig. b, c).\nOn computed tomography (CT) images of the whole spine, isolated OPLL was observed from the lower cervical vertebra to the middle thoracic vertebra. At T6/7, a beak-shaped protrusion into the spinal canal was observed (Figs. a, c).\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the whole spine revealed stenosis with an intensity change in spinal cord at C6/7 and extensive spinal cord compression in the thoracic spine (Figs. b, d). Contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain showed a mass without contrast enhancement on the right side of the anterior pituitary gland (size, 10 mm \u00d7 12 mm \u00d7 10 mm) with suprasellar and parasailer extension; the image revealed a pituitary macroadenoma (Fig. ).\nThe patient\u2019s most remarkable symptom was paraplegia, and we diagnosed myelopathy due to thoracic OPLL. Furthermore, we suspected acromegaly because of the characteristic facial features and blood test findings (ALP 432 IU/L, GH 80.3 ng/ml, IGF-1914 ng/ml). Contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain performed by the endocrinology department showed a pituitary adenoma (Fig. ). The patient\u2019s symptoms satisfied the diagnostic criteria for acromegaly. Neurosurgery was scheduled for the pituitary adenoma, but spinal surgery was prioritized due to fear of exacerbation of neurological symptoms.\nThe neurological findings suggested spinal cord lesions below the T10 level, and T6/7 was judged to be the location of the primary lesion. T1\u20133 and T6\u201311 laminectomy and T1\u201311 posterior fixation were performed. Additionally, there was severe spinal cord compression in C6/7, and open-door laminoplasty with a lamina plate was performed for C5\u20137 (Fig. ).\nOn the third day after the operation, rehabilitation was started with a cervical collar and hard thoracolumbar corset. The postoperative course was good, the paralysis gradually improved, and the patient was able to walk alone indoors. She was discharged 3 weeks after the operation. There have been no adverse or unanticipated events. Two months after the spinal surgery, resection of the pituitary adenoma was performed in the neurosurgery department, and the patient is still under observation. A pathological image (H&E, \u00d7 400) is provided and showed a sheet of monotonous cells with round nuclei and loss of normal lobular patterns of the pituitary adenoma (Fig. ). Staining for TSH and ACTH was negative. Staining for PRL was positive in 10% of the resected pituitary tissue. Staining for CAM5.2 was diffusely positive in many cells and several cells had fibrous bodies. These findings are consistent with growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas.

Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an ill-defined mass lesion that was 2.6 \u00d7 2.4 \u00d7 1.8 cm in size in the left lateral part of the oral cavity (Figures and , stage III, T2N1). He was previously healthy and had no history of systemic disease or medication. Preoperative evaluations, including laboratory tests, electrocardiography, and chest radiography, were unremarkable.\nPatient monitors were instituted, including standard monitors and continuous arterial blood pressure monitoring with radial artery catheter insertion. General anaesthesia was induced with intravenous injections of fentanyl (100 \u03bcg), lidocaine (60 mg), propofol (120 mg), and rocuronium (50 mg) and maintained with 7\u201310 vol% desflurane. After the induction of anaesthesia, nasal packing was performed with cotton swabs moistened with a 0.01% epinephrine solution. Nasotracheal intubation was performed using fibreoptic bronchoscopy (FI-10RBS, Pentax, Japan), and a 6.5 mm reinforced tube was inserted. After intubation, a central venous catheter (CVC, Bio Line, 7 F double lumen catheter, Ewha Biomedics, Republic of Korea) was inserted into the right subclavian vein using the anatomical landmark technique.\nPartial mandibulectomy (from # 21 to the mandibular angle), radical neck dissection, and reconstruction with a fibular free flap were performed (). The operation time was approximately 13 hours and 25 minutes. The infused volume was crystalloid 7200 ml, colloid 1700 ml, packed red blood cells (pRBC) 5 units, and fresh frozen plasma 5 units. The urine output was 3800 ml, and the estimated blood loss was approximately 1800 ml. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and was kept sedated with endotracheal intubation.\nThe patient recovered from anaesthesia 3 hours after the surgery. Ventilator weaning was initiated at 8 AM on the first postoperative day (POD 1), the ventilator was stopped at 1 PM, and oxygen (5 L/min) was administered via a T-piece. The patient did not complain of respiratory difficulties. The patient was evaluated before extubation, and his mental status was alert, muscle tone was intact, surgical wound condition was visually acceptable, and the endotracheal tube cuff leak test was fair. No bleeding was noted from the surgical wound. Blood pressure was maintained between 110/60 mmHg and 140/90 mmHg. Postoperative pain was treated with an intravenous infusion of patient-controlled analgesia with fentanyl and nefopam. There was no dyspnoea, and arterial oxygen saturation was 100%.\nAt 8 AM POD 2, the patient was extubated (approximately 36 hours postsurgery), and oxygen (3 L/min) was administered via a nasal prong. Four hours after extubation, his haemoglobin level decreased to 8.9 ml/dl. One unit of pRBC was transfused.\nSeven hours after extubation (POD 2, 3 PM), the patient complained of dyspnoea, and arterial oxygen saturation decreased from 100% to 87%. Bag-mask ventilation was initiated but was ineffective. Oral and nasal airway insertion was not sufficient to open the airway. Conventional direct laryngoscopy, video laryngoscopy, and laryngeal mask insertion were not successful because the structures in the oral cavity were severely distorted due to operation site oedema and haematoma. An otolaryngologist performed an emergency TT while performing bag-mask ventilation. During TT, the heart rate decreased from 90 bpm to 42 bpm. Intravenous atropine (0.5 mg) and epinephrine (200 \u03bcg) were administered. Ten minutes after the initiation of bag-mask ventilation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated to treat cardiac arrest, and epinephrine (1 mg) was administered every 5 minutes. The TT tube was secured 28 minutes after the initiation of bag-mask ventilation. Blood pressure was 80/30 mmHg, and dopamine, dobutamine, and norepinephrine infusion (20 \u03bcg/kg/min each) were administered. The patient was connected to a ventilator and was sedated with midazolam. On POD 3, midazolam sedation was stopped; however, patient's mental status was semicomatose, and he showed seizure-like movements. A neurology consult was obtained, and postoperative computed tomography showed severe swelling and increased soft tissue density with airway compression in the left side of the face and neck (). On POD 4, a brain MRI showed a diffusely restricted lesion involving the whole cerebral cortex and basal ganglia. The patient received conservative treatment but his mental status did not recover.

Global developmental delay was present from early childhood and she walked independently at 3.5 years of age. Testing with Reynell Developmental Language Scales and British Picture Vocabulary Scale at age 9 years, and Leiter International Performance Scale-Revised (Leiter-R) at age 9 and 10 years, indicated a mental age between 3 and 4 years, with expressive language below 3 years. The test results were consistent with moderate intellectual disability (IQ 35\u201349). A cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination at age 8 years showed unspecific periventricular white matter changes.

Half a month before hospitalization, she complained of double eyelid droop and diplopia; the ocular weakness and fatigue was stable throughout the day and had nothing to do with physical activity. The local hospital suspected myasthenia gravis, a computed tomography scan of her brain revealed nothing, and her serum was collected to detect the acetylcholine antibody. While waiting for a hospital bed, she developed numbness in her right upper and lower extremities. At the same time, she presented with prolonged sleep duration and mental symptoms. She was then transferred to our institution. On admission, she was noted to have difficulty walking by herself due to truncal ataxia. There was no cold, fever, or diarrhea before her symptom onset.\nShe had been suffering from chronic anemia, and her family reported that she had dietary deficiencies due to poor appetite although she denied it herself. She was on no other medications, not pregnant, and did not use alcohol or illicit drugs.\nOn physical examination, the patient presented obviously unbalanced nutrition; she was 1.65 m in height yet only weighed 40 kg. She was conscious and oriented and scored 23 in the MMSE, mainly due to impaired memory and calculation performance. Eye signs were obvious; she had drooping eyelids (both 5 mm). The ophthalmoplegia was remarkable; she demonstrated bilateral abducens nerve palsies and adduction deficit of both eyes. Limitation and nystagmus on vertical gaze were also noted. There was slight dysmetria on both finger\u2013nose and heel\u2013shin testing. Limb dysdiadochokinesia was also observed. Bilateral pyramidal signs were positive. Sensory examination indicated hyperesthesia on the right side. Findings on muscle tone and strength tests were normal.\nShe had an abnormal Hb level of 92 g/L, accompanied by low levels of serum folate and ferritin; vitamin B12 level was normal.

The patient reported this bulge had been present since his adolescence. The hernia had been reducible until age 55, and had become irreducible, thereafter. Medical history included hypertension, diabetes mellitus, asthma and cerebral infarction. He was currently taking one aspirin daily. The patient was 159 cm tall and weighed 84 kg, with a body mass index of 32.2 kg/m2. On physical examination, the bulge in his right inguinal region was roughly the size of an infant's head and the bottom of scrotum descended to his knees in the upright position (Fig. ). Laboratory tests indicated a hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) concentration of 7.0% and a urine glucose concentration of 4+. Lung function tests identified restrictive lung function and pre-operative cardiac ultrasound revealed no local asynergy. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging identified the sigmoid colon with a large amount of feces and the great omentum as part of the contents of the hernia (Fig. ). Although the hernia was irreducible, the patient was planned to undergo an elective surgery for hernia repair due to absence of symptoms of incarceration. Informed consent was obtained from the patient. The patient achieved a weight reduction of 3 kg within 3 months prior to surgery.\nCT on the day of admission showed a hernia sac of 2263 ml, with an intra-abdominal volume of 12 021 ml. Pre-operative bowel preparation with Magcorol P reduced the volume of the hernia contents to 1604 ml, representing a 71% reduction. The intra-abdominal volume was decreased to 10 485 ml.\nThe TAPP procedure was performed under general anesthesia with the patient placed in a slight Trendelenburg position. In the aeroperitoneum, no adhesion between the orifice of the hernia and the abdominal content was identified. With four laparoscopic ports in place (Fig. ), the prolapsed intestine was slowly reduced by applying external pressure to the hernia from outside of the body. Following this procedure, complete reduction of the hernia contents was achieved, with an operative time of 2 h 50 min and a blood loss of approximately 700 ml. The loss of 700 ml of blood was mainly due to the injury caused by forceps when we sought to reduce the incarcerated omentum. We did not dissect the hernia sac, leaving it with the cord distally.\nCT imaging before hernia reduction indicated the diameter of the hernia orifice to be approximately 50 mm, with the posterior wall of the hernia orifice strengthened. A mesh of sufficient area was placed to cover the orifice of the hernia, completely detaching the dorsal aspect of the hernia from the peritoneal membrane up to the dorsal ileocecal region. Given the possibility of tearing of the peritoneal membrane, a VentralightTM ST mesh (Bard Davol Inc., RI, USA), 15 cm in diameter, was used.\nThe patient followed a satisfactory post-operative course. The scrotum on post-operative Day 2 is shown in Fig. . On post-operative Day 2, the patient complained of mild abdominal fullness, which disappeared by post-operative Day 4 (Fig. ).

Her vital signs were normal (blood pressure 118/67 mmHg, heart rate 73 beats per minute, temperature 36.7 \u00b0C).\nBoth horns had a highly suitable endometrium, with a triple line with an average thickness of 10.3 mm. The left horn was chosen because it was more accessible to the left cervix at the moment of embryo transfer. It was planned to transfer one embryo, and the couple was counseled by our high-risk-pregnancy consultant to improve the obstetrics outcome for this uterine anomaly.\nThe first successful IVF journey ended with no need for cerclage and with no obstetrical complication by an elective C-section at 35 weeks for a baby girl of 2800 g weight, 46 cm length, 31.5 cm head circumference, and 7/10 Apgar score at delivery.\nThe couple visited our infertility center again in 2020 with the goal of conceiving a second child. The first child was with them, showing very good progress, normal development, and intelligence as per her parents. They extended their request to transfer one of the frozen embryos.\nThe endometrium was prepared by hormone replacement therapy (HRT) protocol for embryo transfer for the frozen embryo transfer (FET) cycle using 6 mg ethinyl estradiol daily starting from second day of period. Progesterone was added on day 14, when reaching triple-line endometrium with thickness of 11.1 mm. One blastocyst was thawed and survived. The initial decision was to transfer the embryo to the same horn (left) because of the previous successful transfer. The very deep and long vagina forced us to reach one of the cervices. The outer sheet of the embryo transfer catheter was used and showed that we were targeting the right horn.\nEmbryo transfer proceeded successfully and smoothly (Fig. ), in which the embryo was placed in the right uterus without changing or manipulating the anatomy, and the embryo was placed 1 cm from fundus. The patient tolerated the procedure well, and the couple was counseled properly.\nNine days later, her beta human chorionic gonadotropin (b-hCG) level was 258 mIU/ml. A single gestational sac with a viable pregnancy (positive heart beat) was observed in the right uterus, and the patient was referred to our high-risk-pregnancy specialist for follow-up. An elective C-section was performed at 34 weeks for a baby boy of 2650 g weight, 47 cm length, 31 cm head circumference, and 6/10 Apgar score at delivery.", "Question": "Using the Ideal Body Weight Formula, what is the patient's ideal body weight in terms of kg?", "LLM Answer": "61.5", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "50.571", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient's gender is Female.\nThe patient's height is 158.0 cm, which is 158.0 cm * 0.393701 in/cm = 62.205 in. \nFor females, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows:\nIBW = 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60)\nPlugging in the values gives us 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg * (62.205 (in inches) - 60) = 50.571 kg.\nHence, the patient's IBW is 50.571 kg.", "Result": "Incorrect"}

Blood cultures were performed which identified Staphylococcus aureus. Orbital computed tomography (CT) scans identified left eye proptosis and swelling of the periorbital and postbulbar soft tissue, which all led to the diagnosis of orbital cellulitis. The presence of ERD was again verified by orbital CT scans (Fig. d). However, the cause for the orbital cellulitis was not idenitfied in this patient, such as trauma, periorbital cellulitis with local spread, paranasal sinusitis, or hematogenous spread of a remote infection.\nTreatments in this patient were initiated soon after final diagnosis was made.

The vomiting usually occurred in the afternoon and was bilious in nature. Although vomiting was not related to food intake, she had avoided eating because of recurrent vomiting. She also complained of nausea, boring epigastric pain and palpitation, but denied diarrhea or melena. She had lost 8 kg of weight over 4 months, and her weight was 39.4 kg (10-25 percentile) and height was 156 cm (50-75 percentile) at presentation. Past history and family history were not remarkable. She was in Tanner stage 4. Menarche occurred 6 months ago, and menstrual cycles were irregular. Physical examination revealed a dehydrated tongue, cachexic and anxious appearance. Her blood pressure was 100/80 mmHg, pulse rate was 110/min, respiratory rate was 20/min and body temperature was 36.6\u2103. There was no definite enlargement or palpable mass on the anterior neck, eye abnormality or lymphadenopathy. The abdomen was soft with normal bowel sound and there was no direct or rebound tenderness on the abdomen. Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia. Plain abdominal X-ray showed nonspecific findings. Because she had weight loss and palpitation with anxiety, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was included in the initial laboratory test. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy at the first visit of GI outpatient department revealed mild mucosal erythema on Z-line and acute erythematous gastritis with large amount of duodenogastric reflux (). Helicobacter pylori rapid urease test was negative. She was prescribed a proton pump inhibitor, prokinetic and mucosal coating agent (sucralfate) on the basis of her endoscopic diagnosis with GI department follow up after 2 weeks. Her vomiting improved during the first 2 days after medication, however, she visited the emergency department (ED) 5 days later because of recurred vomiting and boring epigastric pain. Her blood pressure was 140/80 mmHg, pulse rate was 88/min, respiratory rate was 20/min and body temperature was 36.8\u2103. Physical examination revealed mild epigastric direct tenderness. The physician of the ED found that she already had blood tests including TSH at GI outpatient department and it revealed TSH < 0.01 \u00b5IU/mL (normal range 0.35-5.55 \u00b5IU/mL). Complete blood count with differential, electrolyte and glucose were within normal limit. A liver function tests showed albumin 4.34 g/dL (normal range 3.8-5.3 g/dL), total bilirubin 2.47 mg/dL (normal range 0.3-1.2 mg/dL), alkaline phosphatase 139 IU/L (normal range 25-100 IU/L), AST 30 IU/L (normal range 0-35 IU/L) and ALT 38 IU/L (normal range 0-35 IU/L). A repeated liver function test at ED showed total bilirubin 1.7 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 133 IU/L, AST 30 IU/L, ALT 42 IU/L and magnesium and calcium were within normal limit. Subsequent blood tests for the thyroid showed free triiodothyroxine (T3) > 8.0 ng/mL (normal range 0.60-1.81 ng/mL), free thyroxine (T4) > 12.0 ng/dL (normal range 0.89-1.76 ng/dL), TSH receptor antibody 37.4% (normal range \u2264 15.0%), anti-thyroid microsomal antibody 6.22 U/mL (normal range \u2264 3.0 U/mL) and thyroglobulin antibody 6.91 U/mL (normal range \u2264 3.0 U/mL). Thyroid ultrasonography revealed diffusely enlarged glands, decreased parenchymal echogenecity and increased vascularity of both glands (). Treatment was initiated with propylthiouracil (PTU) 3.75mg/kg/day and propranolol 1 mg/kg/day, after 4 days of treatment, vomiting, epigastric pain and palpitation were improved remarkably. She was discharged with a maintenance dose of PTU (3.75 mg/kg/day) without prokinetic or proton pump inhibitor.\nShe was hospitalized again 5 days later because vomiting had recurred. Liver function tests returned to normal limits, but thyroid function tests were still elevated (TSH < 0.01 \u00b5IU/mL, free T3 6.31 ng/mL and free T4 5.09 ng/dL). We switched treatment from PTU to methimazole 0.4 mg/kg/day and added inorganic iodine (Lugol's solution) for 5 days to prevent thyroid hormone release. After 3 days, there was no further vomiting, and free T3 and free T4 were decreased to 4.46 ng/mL and 2.24 ng/dL, respectively. She was discharged with a maintenance dose of methimazole (0.4 mg/kg/day) and propranolol (1 mg/kg/day).\nAfter 2 months with methimazole and propranolol maintenance therapy, her symptoms were stable and free T4 returned to normal limits (1.27 ng/dL) despite still having low level of TSH (< 0.01 \u00b5IU/mL).

Because the INR is between 1.7 and 2.3, we add two to the score, making the current total 0 + 2 = 2.\nThe concentration of bilirubin is 40.2 \u00b5mol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of bilirubin from \u00b5mol to mg. The mass of bilirubin is 40.2 \u00b5mol. To convert 40.2 \u00b5mol of bilirubin to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 40.2 \u00b5mol bilirubin * 1e-06 mol/\u00b5mol = 4.02e-05 mol bilirubin. To convert from mol bilirubin to grams, multiply by the molar mass 548.66 g/mol, which will give 4.02e-05 mol bilirubin * 548.66 g/mol = 0.022 g bilirubin. To convert 0.022 g of bilirubin to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.022 g bilirubin * 1000.0 mg/g = 22.0 mg bilirubin. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 22.0 mg bilirubin/10.0 dL = 2.2 mg bilirubin/dL. The concentration value of 40.2 \u00b5mol bilirubin/L converts to 2.2 mg bilirubin/dL.

Cardiovascular risk factors included diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and smoking. Despite aggressive medical therapy, frequent rest angina and short of breath recurred at the time of admission to our hospital. Physical examination revealed fine wet rales in the bottom part of the lung. Laboratory values showed troponin I (TnI) of 1.17 ng/mL (normal range 0 - 0.05 ng/mL), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 4.6 mmol/L, creatinine of 93 \u03bcmol/L, fasting plasma glucose of 9.64 mmol/L, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 6.7%, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) of 1,958.5 pg/mL (normal range 0 - 125 pg/mL). Electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated normal sinus rhythm and anterior precordial leads ST-segment elevation and T waves inversion (). An echocardiogram revealed an enlarged left ventricular cavity (left ventricular end-diastolic dimension 61 mm, left ventricular end-systolic dimension 42 mm) and a nearly normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 53% with segmental wall-motion abnormalities: hypokinesis in anterior wall and the septum. The diagnosis of subacute anterior STEMI was made based on the history and clinical examination. Cardiac catheterization revealed a subtotal occlusion in the proximal and middle part of left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), mild stenosis in the left main coronary artery (LM) () and diffuse lesion in the proximal and 85% stenosis in the distal part of right coronary artery (RCA) (). According to the patient\u2019s SYNTAX score of 22, we decided to perform PCI for these lesions.\nAfter predilation with 1.5 \u00d7 15 mm and 2.0 \u00d7 20 mm Ryujin balloons (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan), two sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) were implanted successfully: Firebird (MicroPort Medical, Shanghai, China) 2.75 \u00d7 23 mm in middle LAD and Excel (JW Medical, Shandong, China) 3.0 \u00d7 24 mm in the proximal LAD (2 to 3-mm overlap at the ends). Post-dilation was performed with a non-compliance 3.0 \u00d7 24 mm Maverick Quantum balloon (Boston Scientific, Boston, MA). TIMI-3 flow was noted and no significant residual stenosis remained (). After the procedure, daily oral DAPT of clopidogrel 75 mg and aspirin (ASA) 300 mg were prescribed. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist tirofiban was initially given as rapid intravenous infusion at a rate of 0.4 \u03bcg/kg/min for 30 min. Upon completion of the initial infusion, the rate is decreased to 0.15 \u03bcg/kg/min delivered as continuous infusion for about 36 h.\nApproximately 2 h after the end of tirofiban administration, the patient developed severe chest pain and T-wave pseudonormalization in the anterior leads on ECG. He was immediately moved to the catheterization lab for repeat coronary angiography (CAG) and ST was found in LAD (). In consideration of the possibility of a dissection at the proximal stent edge (), an additional SES of Partner 3.0 \u00d7 21 mm (Lepu Medical, Beijing, China) was deployed, overlapping the previous proximal stent edge, with an excellent final result (). Then, Partner 4.0 \u00d7 15 mm (Lepu Medical, Beijing, China) and Taxus 4.0 \u00d7 38 mm (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA) were implanted in the distal and proximal segment of RCA, respectively (). The patient\u2019s clopidogrel dose was increased to 75 mg twice a day because he was found to be hyporesponsive to clopidogrel when tested for adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation utilizing with light transmission aggregometry (LTA). He did not taking any drugs that could deteriorate the platelet function, including proton pump inhibitor. Tirofiban was given as continuous infusion for about 72 h. The patient had an uneventful recovery in the following 5 days.\nUnfortunately, the patient again underwent severe chest pain in the sixth day after the second PCI, and the ECG showed ST-segment elevation in V1-V5 leads (). Misgiving about the uncertainty of the reason for recurrent ST, surgeons refused to perform coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). After failure of initial thrombolytic therapy, he underwent emergent salvage angiography by a different interventionalist. Emergency CAG showed total occlusion of the mid-LAD due to ST (). Thrombi were aspirated with the Diver CE aspiration catheter (Invatec, Brescia, Italy). Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) revealed inadequate stent expansion due to elastic recoil (). This was repaired by repeated high-pressure post-dilation with 3.0 \u00d7 12 mm and 3.5 \u00d7 15 mm NC Sprinter balloons (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) (). Despite the double dose of clopidogrel therapy, ADP-induced platelet aggregation showed that she was still hyporesponsive to clopidogrel. The patient had an uncomplicated recovery and was discharged 1 week later with triple anti-platelet therapy (aspirin 300 mg qd, clopidogrel 75 mg bid, and cilostazol 100 mg bid).\nThe patient\u2019s chest pain recurred again 6 days thereafter. Repeat emergent CAG revealed patent RCA stents and total occlusion of the mid-LAD due to ST (). Surgeons still refused to perform CABG for this patient. Diver CE aspiration catheter (Invatec, Brescia, Italy) was used again. Given the possibility of a dissection at the distal stent edge (), we deployed another SES of Firebird (MicroPort Medical, Shanghai, China) 2.5 \u00d7 29 mm in distal-LAD, overlapping the previous distal stent edge. The final result revealed no residual stenosis or dissection and excellent TIMI-3 flow (). Upon completion of continuous infusion of tirofiban for about 7 days, the patient was discharged. He was hemodynamically stable and symptom-free at the time of discharge. Echocardiogram revealed a decreased LVEF of 48%. Laboratory retest showed low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 1.6 mmol/L, creatinine of 96 \u03bcmol/L, and fasting plasma glucose of 6.02 mmol/L. Although the patient has complied strictly with the triple anti-platelet therapy (aspirin 300 mg qd, clopidogrel 75 mg bid, and cilostazol 100 mg bid), ADP-induced platelet aggregation showed that she was still hyporesponsive to clopidogrel.

A diagnosis of bacterial infection was suspected and she was administered oral antibiotics like amoxicillin. Symptoms grew progressively worsen over time. Five days later, she was admitted to the same hospital for repeated fever and headache as well as bloody purulent stools. After treatment with cephalosporin, symptoms improved. Six days after admission, she presented a sudden left-sided hemiparesis and numbness, accompanied by intermittent convulsion. Urgent computed tomography (CT) showed an area of low density in the right frontal lobe. A further magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an abnormal signal in the right frontal and left temporal area. Magnetic resonance venogram (MRV) showed the left venous sinus were not visualize with collateral circulation extensiveness formation. Electrocardiogram showed frequent ventricular premature beat. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed thrombus formation in the superior mesenteric arterial hypoechoic. A diagnosis of cerebral infarction was highly suspected. After reducing intracranial pressure and anticoagulant therapy, no improvement was found with her consciousness and hemiparesis, so she was transferred to our hospital on April 25, 2017.\nOn admission, she was moderately emaciated, hypotensive, and her body temperature was 37.8 \u00b0C. She did not have any vascular risk factor. Her personal and family history was normal besides. Neurological examination revealed hemiplegia with a positive Babinski sign on left side.\nBiochemical tests revealed hyperleukocytosis (17.4 \u00d7 109/L), moderate anemia (hemoglobin, 88 g/L, hematocrit, 27.8%), hypoalbuminemia (albumin, 30.4 g/L), and elevated levels of C-reactive protein and procalcitonin. A coagulation test revealed an elevation of D-Dimer. Antinuclear antibodies, including anticardiolipin, antinuclear antibody, antismooth muscle antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody, and rheumatoid factor were negative. A thrombophilia workup including anticardiolipin, antiphospholipid antibodies, homocysteine, antithrombin was performed and showed normal results.\nAfter admission, due to severe hematochezia, colonoscopy was unable to perform to determine the cause. At that time the patient was only placed on omeprazole (20 mg QD) for protecting gastrointestinal mucosa. In surprise, symptoms of hematochezia disappeared when treated with frozen plasma and erythrocytes transfusion. The anticoagulation therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH; 4000 IU BID) was started, and DSA was performed followed, which confirmed multiple thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus with secondary hemorrhage (Fig. A). Interventional therapy with guide wire was administered simultaneously (Fig. B\u2013D). After operation, the patient was treated with Warfarin Sodium Tablets (2.5 mg QD) and LMWH. CT scan (Fig. ) in 10 days demonstrated a residual left-sided forntal infarction. Twenty days after admission a follow-up MR venography showed partial recanalization of superior sagittal sinus, a filling defect of left sigmoid, and underdevelopment of left transverse sinus (Fig. A\u2013B). MRI (Fig. ) at the same time showed infarctions in the left frontal and temporal lobes. Five days later, with clinical improvement, she was discharged home. She switched to Warfarin Sodium Tablets (2.5 mg QD) only which was withdrawn after a few days with no other recurrent strokes and a slow improvement of her neurological condition.\nThe patient received another hospitalization for recurrence after 1 year and a colonoscopy was taken (Fig. ), then ulcerative colitis was confirmed. A follow-up MR venography showed a similar situation as before (Fig. C).

Symptoms initiated three days prior to admission with a severe abrupt-onset entire left lower extremity pain and claudication not relieved by analgesics. He had a 10 pack-year history of cigarette smoking and a multipartner sexual relationship. Otherwise, his medical history showed a healthy young man up to the present illness. The patient\u2019s family history was unremarkable for thrombophilia. In physical examination, he was afebrile with a good general appearance and his blood pressure, pulse rate and respiratory rate were 120/80 mmHg, 100 bpm and 16/min, respectively. His left lower extremity was cold from knee down and bluish discoloration of digits was noted.\nLeft femoral artery pulse was undetectable as well as its subsequent branches. Sensory and motor functions of the entire left lower extremity were intact. Other parts of physical examination had normal findings except for an oral aphthous lesion and a healing genital ulcer with a negative Pathergy test. Color-Doppler sonography of the left lower extremity arteries revealed a thrombus in the left common iliac artery, 5 cm in length, initiating from the abdominal aorta bifurcation. Trivial blood flow in the common iliac artery and decreased blood flow in the lower branches were found, so that the blood flow velocity was 27 cm/sec in the left common femoral artery compared to 58 cm/sec velocity of the normal opposite side. Evaluation of distal arteries including anterior and posterior tibialis arteries demonstrated a complete thrombosis in the lower halves of both with no blood flow. Anticoagulant therapy was promptly initiated and Fogarty catheter was inserted for proximal thrombectomy. After the operation, the patient\u2019s end extremity was warm and he felt no pain anymore. Weak pulses of both dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis arteries were also detectable. Forty-eight hours later, the patient developed another episode of cold end extremity and pulselessness in the same limb. In color-doppler sonography, despite establishment of triphasic blood flow of the left lower extremity arteries up to midpart of distal arteries, no flow was detected in the distal halves of anterior and posterior tibialis arteries due to an embolus/thrombus. Therefore, the patient underwent Fogarty insertion for thrombectomy again. After the second surgery, all previous symptoms and signs were removed and follow-up CT-angiography revealed normal course and caliber of all the arteries of the left lower extremity with no evidence of collateral formation in favor of chronic vascular insufficiency. Meanwhile, to find out the reason of recurrent thromboembolic events in an otherwise healthy young man, an extensive work-up was performed. Lab investigation revealed a CBC with Hg of 16.7 g/dL, WBC of 7000/mm3 and platelet count of 179000/mm3. PT, INR and PTT were 13 seconds, 1 and 25 seconds, respectively. Lipid profile showed total cholesterol of 202 gr/dL, TG of 146 gr/dL, HDL-c of 37 gr/dL and LDL-c of 136 gr/dL. Serum levels of antiphospholipid-antibodies, anticardiolipin antibody (ACLA), P- and C-ANCA and anti-\u03b22 glycoprotein IgM and IgG were all within the normal ranges. Liver function test showed no abnormality and viral markers for hepatitis B and C had negative results. Homocysteine level was normal and LDH was 445 IU/L. Coagulation factor assay revealed no abnormal findings and results were not in favor of protein C/S or antithrombin deficiency. Investigations showed no factor V Leiden gene mutation. Other blood tests had normal findings. Regarding proximal involvement of lower extremity arteries, abdomen pelvic sonography, helical chest and abdomenopelvic CT-scan demonstrated no mass, organomegally or the third space fluid collection. EKG (electrocardiography) and trans esophageal echocardiography (TEE) excluded any cardiogenic source of emboli. Ultimately, we found a reactive HIV Ab ELISA with the same result in repetition. Western blot test confirmed the diagnosis of HIV infection. The patient was then discharged with antiplatelet and anticoagulant and referred to a HIV center to receive medical support.

Additionally, she reported 4-5 days of erythematous rash that began on her face and chest that then spread to her arms and abdomen (Figures -). She also reported white \u201cspots\u201d in her mouth. At that time, CBC, CRP, ESR, CK, and UA were within normal limits. Lipase was 675 U/L and CMP was remarkable for sodium 129 mEq/L, amino alanine transferase (ALT) 158 U/L, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 111 U/L; the rest of the CMP including alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was normal. CXR was normal and abdominal radiograph showed evidence of constipation. An abdominal ultrasound was ordered due to elevated lipase and LFTs and showed no evidence of gallbladder dysfunction or liver lesions. She was diagnosed with pancreatitis, thrush, and folliculitis and was discharged home with clear liquid diet orders and prescriptions for nystatin oral solution and oral doxycycline for possible secondary skin infection. Two days later, she returned to the ED with persistent symptoms and decreased urine output. She reported nausea, constipation, and worsened dysphagia, but denied vomiting, weight change, night sweats, fever, chills, chest pain, cough, and shortness of breath. She also denied pertinent past surgeries, family history, recent travel, sexual activity, drug use, and alcohol and tobacco use. She reported allergy to penicillin. Her medication list included prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil (which she held since previous ED visit per doctor recommendations), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (T/S), nystatin oral suspension, carvedilol, ranitidine, estradiol, calcium, and vitamin D. She was told by her dermatologist not to fill the doxycycline prescription from the ED and increase the dose of T/S.\nOn physical examination, the patient was alert and oriented with normal vital signs. The exam was significant for oral thrush, but normal heart, lung, and abdominal exams. Skin exam showed a diffuse maculopapular eruption with a few vesicles on face, trunk, and extremities. Significant laboratory data was as follows: AST 1389 U/L, ALT 1570 U/L, ALP 68 U/L, international normalized ratio (INR) 1.6, and prothrombin time (PT) 18 seconds. Complete abdominal ultrasound demonstrated normal gallbladder without stones, no biliary ductal dilation, no focal liver lesions, and no ascites or abnormal fluid collections. The patient's dermatologist had performed skin biopsies 2 days prior to admission that showed multinucleated giant cells with viral inclusions suggestive of some type of herpes virus infection (Figures \u2013). The patient was initiated on intravenous (IV) acyclovir, micafungin, vancomycin, aztreonam, and stress dose steroids for presumed disseminated herpes simplex with possible secondary bacterial infection and sepsis. Over the subsequent 48-72 hours, AST and ALT increased to the 4000s, INR increased to 1.8 and PT to 20.6. Due to worsening acute liver failure, she was transferred to our facility for liver transplant evaluation.\nOn arrival to our hospital, her skin lesions were thought to be most consistent with VZV and skin biopsy cultures from the outpatient dermatologist later confirmed VZV. IV acyclovir and antibiotics for secondary bacterial sepsis were continued. As part of her liver transplant evaluation, extensive serologic investigation ensued. Acute hepatitis A-E serologies, ANA, IgG4, smooth muscle antibody (Ab), LKM-1 Ab, ceruloplasmin, a-1 antitrypsin, mitochondrial M2 Ab, AFP, HIV, HSV and EBV PCRs, blood cultures, galactomannan, and cryptococcal antigen were submitted and later found to be negative. She was also found to be pANCA MPO positive and PR3 negative. Liver biopsy was performed which revealed multiple areas of necrotic hepatocytes (up to 35% of liver parenchyma) (Figures -) in zones 2 and 3 of the liver. This was associated with some bile extravasation and acute inflammation. No signs of bridging or confluent necrosis were seen. A trichrome stain outlined regions of immature deposition of collagen near necrotic areas. This stain also showed increased perivenular fibrosis around the central veins but no evidence of periportal fibrosis. The portal triads showed nominal chronic inflammation with small lymphocytes, rare large lymphocytes, and a few scattered neutrophils. There was no bile duct injury, paucity, or vasculitis. The hepatocytes did not demonstrate significant steatosis, but there was bile stasis in a few canalicular spaces and hepatocytes. Viral inclusions were not seen. An iron stain showed no accumulation of hemosiderin within the hepatocytes. PCR was negative for HSV, EBV, and CMV and positive for VZV. The necrosis also abutted portal triads seen in the specimens (). A Periodic acid-Schiff stain with diastase did not show cytoplasmic globules. Blood PCRs were positive with high levels of VZV and low levels of CMV. The CMV viremia was attributed to secondary reactivation due to her severely immunosuppressed state. VZV immune globulin was considered as therapy, but IVIG was administered instead due to her severe coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia. Outpatient skin biopsy cultures later confirmed VZV; PCR was positive for VZV and negative for HSV.\nHer hospital stay was complicated by multidrug-resistant Enterobacter cloacae hospital acquired pneumonia and bacteremia, respiratory failure requiring prolonged intubation, and multiple organ failure. VZV PCR copies decreased with treatment, but her severity of illness and active infection prevented liver transplantation.

In the emergency room, her blood pressure was 90/48 mm Hg, pulse rate was 88 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute, body temperature was 38.0\u00b0C, and oxygen saturation was 91% in room air. Her mental status was drowsy. She complained of mild abdominal pain and dyspnea. Physical examination revealed crackles over the left lower lung field. The abdomen was massively distended with reduced bowel sounds. Diffuse mild tenderness was noted in the entire abdomen.\nThe initial laboratory evaluation provided the following results: white blood cell count, 8,850 cells/mm3 (neutrophils, 90.3%); hemoglobin, 10.2 g/dL; hematocrit, 30.6%; platelet count, 182\u00d7103 cells/mm3; erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 42 mm/hr; C-reactive protein, 19.41 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 78.9 mg/dL; procalcitonin, 3.75 mg/mL; and creatinine, 2.46 mg/dL. Arterial blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.502, pCO2 of 22 mm Hg, pO2 of 63.5 mm Hg, HCO3 of 17.4 mmol/L, and SaO2 of 94.5% with oxygen at a rate of 2 L/min via a nasal cannula.

For twenty years, she has been treated for lupus and its pulmonologic and renal complications at other hospitals. Two years ago, she underwent transarterial embolization of her bronchial artery due to hemoptysis. Two month later, she visited the cardiovascular department of this hospital with severe chest pain, and underwent PCI in the mid left anterior descending artery (LAD), and its diagonal branch with a 3.0\u00d732 mm Taxus\u00ae Express2 paclitaxel-eluting stent (Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, MA, USA) for the mid LAD and a 2.5\u00d724 mm Taxus\u00ae stent for the diagonal branch. Since the PCI, she has been taking aspirin, 100 mg; clopidogrel, 75 mg and cilostazol, 100 mg for coronary artery disease treatment and prednisolone, 5 mg and hydroxyquinolone for lupus treatment. On visiting the emergency department, her electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in V1-V4. Her laboratory data revealed 206 ng/mL of creatine phospho kinase, 17.8 ng/mL of creatine kinase-MB level and 1.69 ng/mL of troponin-I level. She was diagnosed with an anterior-septal ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and taken immediately to the catheterization laboratory. Coronary angiography (CAG) revealed total occlusion over the previous stent site of the mid LAD and the diagonal branch (), therefore we performed balloon angioplasty to treat the total occluded lesion of the mid LAD. However, we could not perform any intervention for the diagonal branch due to wiring failure. The final angiogram after balloon angioplasty showed thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) grade III flow of the LAD and moderate stenosis of the proximal LAD (). The patient was discharged without complications.\nHowever, five weeks later, the patient presented to our emergency department with severe chest pain associated with ST elevation on ECG on arrival. Under suspicion of recurrent stent thrombosis, we performed emergency CAG, which showed thrombotic re-occlusion of the LAD stent with TIMI grade 0 flow. We elected to perform balloon angioplasty and deployed a 3.0\u00d718 mm XIENCE V stent (Abbott vascular, Redwood City, CA, USA) to cover the progressed lesion of the proximal LAD, overlapping the proximal part of the previous stent. Her final angiogram demonstrated a TIMI grade III flow of the LAD (). Subsequently, we checked her platelet function using a PFA 100\u00ae system (Dade International, Miami, FL, USA). The measured closure time with epinephrine cartridges was 178 seconds (normal range: 192-78), and with ADP cartridges, it was 92 seconds (normal range: 146-58). The patient recovered without cardiac complications. She was discharged five days later with aspirin (100 mg daily), clopidogrel (75 mg daily) and cilostazole (50 mg, twice a day).\nThe patient visited our emergency department again after 8 weeks with recurrent chest pain associated with ST elevation on her ECG. An emergency coronary angiogram showed thrombotic re-occlusion of the mid portion of the previous LAD stent, similar to the previous event. We then performed balloon angioplasty with a 3.0\u00d715 mm VOYAGER(TM) NC balloon (Abbott vascular, Redwood City, CA, USA), which successfully established TMI grade III flow. Subsequent laboratory data on SLE disease and coagulation states revealed her stable lupus and no coagulation abnormalities: lupus anticoagulant: negative, Anti cardiolipin Ab IgG/M: negative, Anti Phospholipid Ab IgG: 3.8 GPLunit/mL, Anti Phospholipid IgM: 0.7 MPLunit/mL, C3: 119 ng/dL {Normal (N): 160-86}, C4: 20.34 ng/dL (N: 17-45), Homocystein 6 umol/L (N: 5-15), Protein C activity: 110% (N: 70-130), Protein S activity: 65% (N: 55-123). She was discharged with a double dose of aspirin (200 mg daily) and clopidogrel (150 mg daily).\nFive months after her last discharge, she visited our emergency department again with recurrent chest pain. The ECG again showed ST elevation of the precordial lead and CAG showed stent thrombosis, similar to the previous event. However, after balloon angioplasty, multiple thrombi in the distal part of the stent and disease progression at the edge of stent were shown (). We therefore performed an intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), which showed eccentric plaque with thrombi in the stent and isoechoic plaque with significant stenosis at the distal edge of the stent (). After performing the IVUS, we deployed a 3.0\u00d730 mm Endeavor\u00ae Resolute stent (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) for this lesion, overlapping the previous stent. Final angiographic findings showed good distal flow ().

She had recurrent substernal chest pain, increasing in severity, without radiation or associated symptoms during the preceding week. She denied any specific alleviating or provoking factors.\nPast medical history was significant for hypertension and stage IIIA nonsmall cell lung carcinoma which was diagnosed eight years earlier. She had been treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. One year later she developed a malignant pericardial effusion, treated with a pericardial window, and recurrent pleural effusions, which were drained with pleural catheters. During the next six years, she was in full remission as confirmed by annual chest computed tomography (CT). Her medications included aspirin, metoprolol, iron, vitamin B12, and gefitinib. She was a nonsmoker and drinks alcohol occasionally.\nAt presentation, her physical exam was benign. Initial cardiac biomarkers (creatine phosphokinase, troponin) and fasting lipid panel were within normal limits. The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm without any significant ST-T changes. Chest radiograph showed left perihilar parenchymal scars, surgical clips, and postoperative changes in the chest (). Other laboratory studies, including two more sets of cardiac biomarkers, were normal.\nShe underwent an exercise nuclear stress test which demonstrated indeterminate electrocardiogram (ECG) changes with a small anteroseptal wall defect which appeared to be artifactual. Following the stress test, she developed retrosternal chest pain. Although her ECG did not show any acute changes, repeat serum troponin level was elevated at 0.42 ug/L. Coronary angiography was performed and demonstrated 90% stenosis of the left main coronary artery ostium, dominant right coronary artery, and no evidence of any atherosclerotic disease or stenosis in other coronary arteries (Figures , , and ). Left ventricular ejection fraction was 55% without any regional wall motion abnormalities.\nSyntax score was calculated to be 12% which predicts comparable outcomes of surgical and angioplastic procedures. Taking into consideration patient's history that may complicate the surgical treatment including her previous surgical interventions, radiation therapy, and chemical therapy, the interventional cardiology team recommended percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the lesion. Cardiothoracic surgeons were consulted as well for further evaluation and they agreed that surgery will be challenging in this patient, but at the same time they felt that she may tolerate the surgery well, given her functional status, remission from cancer, and the low operative risk (EuroScore is 1.23%), and they suggested coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery as a reasonable option due to the high failure rate of stenting ostial lesions and to avoid the possible cardiac arrest associated with the intervention on the stenotic ostium of left main coronary artery.\nAfter discussing both treatment options, the risks and benefits of each procedure with the patient, she decided to undergo surgical revascularization. Overnight, she experienced excruciating anginal chest pain without any elevation in cardiac enzymes; as a result she was taken to surgery the next day.\nIntraoperatively she was noted to have dense adhesions surrounding the heart. As a result, she developed severe bleeding from the adhesions. Despite aggressive transfusion of red blood cells and platelets, bleeding could not be controlled and she died during surgery.

One week prior to ED admission, his GI had ordered precautionary leukocytes and C. diff due to history of UC, and both returned positive. Per GI note, \"Vancomycin prescribed as this patient has IBD and patients with IBD can develop spontaneous C. diff infections and need to be treated regardless of toxin presence.\" He had no prior history of antibiotic use over the past three months or triggering factor for C. diff infection.\nOver the course of the week, his symptoms progressed, and he claimed to have nausea, vomiting, and hematochezia.\nThe patient presented with a past medical history of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and obstructive sleep apnea. His allergies included trazodone and amoxicillin/clavulanate. His family history was unrevealing. His surgical history included cholecystectomy and thyroglossal duct cyst removal in 2019.\nThis patient was a nonsmoker. He denied alcohol or drug use. He tried to maintain a healthy diet of lean proteins, fruits, and vegetables.\nInitial vitals on presentation included: temperature: 98.6 F, pulse: 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute, pulse oximetry: 95%, blood pressure: 119/87 mmHg, weight: 217.16 lbs, and body mass index: 32.14.\nGeneral surgery was consulted upon CT scan with IV contrast revealing new extraluminal gas in the perineum surrounding the anus and distal rectum (Figures , , , ). He was examined and subsequently diagnosed with rectal perforation.\nPreoperatively, the patient\u2019s physical exam revealed an uncomfortable looking young man in mild distress due to abdominal pain. An abdominal exam revealed no distention, masses, rebound, or guarding. The absence of McBurney\u2019s sign, Murphy\u2019s sign, and peritoneal inflammation was noted. There was no active rectal bleeding at the time of physical examination. Laboratory data revealed an elevated c-reactive protein of 66.4. Complete blood count and complete metabolic panel were otherwise within normal limits. Despite infection and imaging reflecting perforation, white blood count was found to be 5.9 k/cmm.\nAfter review of the available data, assessment of clinical condition, and deliberation with the emergency department physicians and the patient\u2019s primary gastroenterology physician, the surgery team decided the patient would require an urgent exploratory laparotomy with total abdominal colectomy and end ileostomy due to the diagnosis of rectal perforation secondary to C. diff colitis on chronic UC.\nThe patient was immediately brought to the operating room. The primary incision was made from the subxiphoid to the pubic symphysis within two hours of initial presentation to the hospital. The colon was visualized and resected; thus, a total colectomy was undergone. The pre-rectal space was opened to identify signs of purulence or injury, which found crepitus and severe UC causing circumferential ulcerations and a deep ulcer in the midline anteriorly. These ulcers traversed all layers of the rectal wall. A drain was placed to drain potential abscess or infection from the pre-rectal space.\nThe patient left the OR in stable condition after enduring no complications intraoperatively. He remained in the inpatient surgical unit for five days, during which he continued to advance his diet and ambulate successfully. He was discharged after an education session on ostomy bag maintenance and told to follow up with the general surgery team and gastroenterology team in one week. At his one-week follow-up post-op visit, the patient was doing well, ostomy output was draining appropriately, and he denied fever, nausea, or vomiting.

Excisional biopsy was the treatment of choice as it was a type two transformational zone. A laser cone was performed instead of a loop electrosurgical excisional procedure (LEEP) in view of a large transformational zone. Subsequent follow up cervical smear and examination were normal.

The patient was an alcoholic with a past medical history of chronic bronchitis and coronary heart disease. The illness began with flu-like symptoms, including a high fever (38.3 \u00b0C), cough with yellow-white phlegm and feeling fatigued on 30 January 2014. Because the detection of the influenza A virus universal antigen was negative on the throat-swab by means of the immune colloidal gold technique and the radiologic findings revealed bronchitis, the patient was treated with anti-infective therapy by an intravenous injection of moxifloxacin. However, that treatment did not take effect, and the symptoms gradually worsened.\nOn 5 February 2014, the patient appeared with hyperpyrexia (maximum temperature 40.0 \u00b0C), coughing with bloody sputum and dyspnoea with a low oxygen saturation (88.8%). The H7N9 viral RNA was positive in the oropharynx swab confirmed by the real-time RT-PCR method according to the protocol of the Chinese CDC. The patient was transferred into the intensive care unit (ICU) of Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University. The case was diagnosed as a laboratory-confirmed case of influenza A (H7N9) infection with severe pneumonia combined with the complications of acute respiratory failure, septic shock, stress ulcer and acute renal failure. Antiviral treatment (oseltamivir) with combination of antibiotics (Sulperazon), a gastric acid secretion inhibitor (omeprazole), mechanical ventilation, continuous renal replacement, supportive nutrition therapy and symptomatic treatment were given. On 12 February 2014, the H7N9 viral nucleic acid was negative when detecting the tracheal aspirate specimens by real-time RT-PCR.

The panel-reactive antibody test of the recipient and crossmatch were negative with two mismatches of HLA-A and HLA-DQ. Neither the recipient nor donor had a history of CD. Serum antibodies to HIV, EBV, and CMV were negative before the operation. The recipient received induction therapy with a 14-day course of antilymphocyte globulin (Pressimum; Behringwerke AG, Marburg, Germany). The immunosuppressive therapy started 3 days prior to transplantation. The immunosuppressive regimen consisted of tacrolimus at 3.5 mg twice daily, mycophenolate mofetil beginning at 750 mg twice daily and tapered off during a 4-week period, prednisone beginning at 20 mg daily and tapered off during a 6-week period, and valganciclovir at 450 mg daily for 3 months post-transplantation. The prednisone was withdrawn in the second month after transplantation because of gastrointestinal bleeding. At 4 years post-transplantation, the serum globulin level was found to have gradually increased without any patient discomfort. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities. The serum creatinine level was maintained at a normal level, fluctuating from 1.1 to 1.2 mg/dL, and the urine protein was negative. The white blood cell count was mildly elevated at 10,580 cells/mm3 (normal range, 4000\u201310,000 cells/mm3) with 61.5% neutrophils. Serum EBV and CMV immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG antibodies were positive, while serum HIV and HHV-8 antibodies were negative. The RNA qualification of EBV showed 4.6 \u00d7 104 copies/mL, and CMV-DNA was negative. The serum level of interleukin 6 (IL-6) was normal. B-mode ultrasonography and computed tomography showed multiple lymphadenectases, including the bilateral cervical, inguinal, and abdominal cavity lymph nodes. No visceral enlargement or bone marrow involvement was found. Furthermore, positron emission tomography showed no abnormal metabolic signals of organomegaly or extranodal masses. Serum protein electrophoresis showed a high serum free light chain \u03ba/\u03bb level and low \u03ba/\u03bb ratio. Serum protein electrophoresis also showed an elevated percentage of gamma globulin but did not identify the monoclonal gammopathy. Immunofixation electrophoresis showed M protein negativity ().\nThe patient underwent biopsy of the right inguinal lymph node in a local hospital. The pathologic examination revealed a follicular pattern with some hyperplastic germinal centers, most of which were small and similarly sized with a round or oval shape. Numerous mature plasma cells were seen in medullary cords (). Cohesive large cells were present mainly in sinuses, and monocytoid B-cell proliferation was scattered in the mantle zone of the follicles; these B cells exhibited features of immunoblasts or anaplastic large cells (). Focally, the architecture was entirely destroyed by sheets of large typical cells. The pathological diagnosis was reactive lymphoid tissue of proliferated lymph nodes and slightly increased plasma cells increased in the medulla of the lymph nodes. Immunohistochemistry showed positive staining of CD3, CD5, CD43, CD38, CD138, CD21, CD23, CD20, CD79, BCL2, and Ki-67 (<10%) in the large cells, with negative staining of CK, CD10, CD56, cyclin D1, SOX11, and IgG4. EBV-encoded early RNAs were found in the plasma cells based on in situ hybridization, while CMV inclusion bodies were not observed.\nBecause of the persistently elevated immunoglobulin level and generalized lymph node enlargement, another celiac lymph node biopsy was performed. Pathological evaluation of the celiac lymph node showed that multiple lymphoid follicles had been infiltrated by a large number of mature plasma cells. A few small blood vessels showed hyaline degeneration with \u201conion skin\u201d like changes. The germinal centers were atrophied, and the proliferation of the sleeve cells and concentric round arrangement were not obvious. The pathological diagnosis was the characteristic plasma cell subtype of CD. The plasma cells were positive for CD3, CD20, CD38, CD138, and Ki-67 (<10%) (). CD138 showed strong positive expression in the plasma cells labeled by polyclonal anti-immunoglobulin kappa light chains and lambda antibodies (). Immunostaining for EBV and CMV was negative. We thereafter adjusted the dosage of immunosuppressants, adding prednisolone at 10 mg once a day, slowly tapering the tacrolimus down from 3.5 mg twice daily to 0.5 mg twice daily, and maintaining the mycophenolate mofetil at 500 mg twice daily. Two months after adjustment of the immunosuppression agents, the elevated immunoglobulin level and enlarged lymph nodes were not ameliorated. Because of the patient\u2019s economic conditions and risk of infection, he did not receive rituximab to treat the multicentric CD. Instead, he received a CHOP chemotherapy regimen consisting of monthly cyclophosphamide (750 g/m2, day 1), vincristine (1.4 g/m2, day 1), doxorubicin (50 g/m2, day 1), and prednisone (60 mg/m2, once daily) for four cycles. After four cycles of chemotherapy, the enlarged lymph nodes had significantly decreased in size (). At the third month of follow-up, the serum globulins had dropped to a normal level (). At the ninth month of follow-up, the size of the lymph nodes located in the abdomen, axilla, and groin had significantly decreased. No acute rejection occurred during the post-transplantation follow-up.

To convert 143.0 \u00b5mol of Pre-Operative Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 143.0 \u00b5mol Pre-Operative Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/\u00b5mol = 0.000143 mol Pre-Operative Creatinine.

To convert 0.016 g of Pre-Operative Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.016 g Pre-Operative Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 16.0 mg Pre-Operative Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 16.0 mg Pre-Operative Creatinine/10.0 dL = 1.6 mg Pre-Operative Creatinine/dL.

CT chest also confirmed an incidental large pericardial effusion (Figure ). Blood cultures were negative. Testing of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) serology was negative. His ECG on this admission was unchanged from prior ECGs. Hemoglobin A1c was 8%, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was 58 mg/dl.

He reported that he had a 10 L paracentesis one year ago. He denied a history of coronary artery disease. The patient also reported that he used alcohol daily and was an active smoker. The patient\u2019s home medications included carvedilol, furosemide, spironolactone, atorvastatin, metformin, and albuterol. The patient\u2019s vital signs were within normal limits. Cardiac examination revealed a systolic murmur at the cardiac apex, however, jugular venous pulsation was unable to be observed because of body habitus. On pulmonary exam, the patient\u2019s lungs were clear to auscultation in all lung fields. The patient had a distended abdomen with a positive fluid wave. The patient did not have lower extremity edema. His laboratory workup was notable for creatinine of 1 mg/dL, platelets of 33 x 103/mm3, INR of 1.1, albumin 3 g/dL, bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL, and pro-brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) of >5000 pg/mL. The chest X-ray was unremarkable (Figure ).\nAt this point the etiology of dyspnea was thought to be related to congestive heart failure or ascites. The history of congestive heart failure, elevated BNP, and orthopnea supported congestive heart failure as the etiology of his dyspnea, but he had a normal lung exam, a normal chest X-ray, and no lower extremity edema. Meanwhile, the abdominal distension, positive fluid wave, and history of a therapeutic paracentesis suggested the presences of marked ascites. Large volume ascites can compress the diaphragm and cause orthopnea and dyspnea. However, management of ascites and congestive heart differ, and it was important to accurately distinguish the two (Table ) [].\nAn attending with five years of POCUS experience then performed POCUS to further assess the patient. Abdominal ultrasound revealed only moderate ascites in the suprapubic region (Video ,B), but no other significant fluid pockets were found in the bilateral lower compartments. This moderate volume of ascites made diaphragmatic compression as the etiology of his dyspnea less likely. To further characterize the etiology of the ascites, the probe was moved to the subxiphoid position to identify the IVC. His IVC was distended more than 2.1 cm with less than 50% collapsibility consistent with an elevated CVP > 10 mmHg (Video ,B) []. In order to characterize the etiology of this high CVP, the probe was then moved to the parasternal position to assess for cardiac pathology. In the parasternal long axis view, the left ventricle demonstrated normal ejection fraction, but the right ventricle was severely dilated, and a moderate pericardial effusion was observed (Video ). In the parasternal short-axis view, the right ventricle was observed to be larger than the left ventricle, with septal flattening during diastole suggesting severe right ventricular dysfunction (Video ).\nA paracentesis revealed 366 x 103/mm3 white blood cells with 61% monocytes and macrophages. The serum-ascites albumin gradient was 1.5, suggestive of portal hypertension. Finally, the ascites total protein was >2.5 g/dL, which confirmed the diagnosis of cardiac ascites. He was started on IV diuresis and had a 20-pound weight loss over the subsequent seven days with resolution of his shortness of breath and orthopnea.\nThe severe right heart dysfunction found on POCUS prompted a workup for pulmonary hypertension. A transthoracic echo confirmed the findings on POCUS including left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%-60%. There was moderate-to-severely dilated right ventricle with moderate-to-severe reduction in right ventricular systolic function. The right atrium was moderately dilated with moderate pulmonary hypertension (right ventricular systolic pressure = 60 mmHg). The IVC was dilated with less than 50% collapse with respiration, and a small pericardial effusion was seen. The patient underwent a right heart catheterization after aggressive IV diuresis which showed a right atrial pressure of 7 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure of 73/26 mmHg, mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) of 45 mmHg, and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 13 mmHg, with a cardiac index of 2.7 L/min/m2 and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) of 498 dyn\u00b7s/cm5. His pulmonary hypertension workup included normal autoimmune serologies, normal diffusion on pulmonary function tests, normal high-resolution chest CT, and a normal V/Q scan. After ruling out secondary causes of pulmonary hypertension, he was diagnosed with Group 1 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension due to PPH.

She was given sublingual nitroglycerin, 325 mg of aspirin to chew, and one 5 mg IV push of metoprolol tartrate. She then received nitroglycerin paste and metoprolol tartrate IV every 5 min for two more doses.

On respiratory examination equal air entry was auscultated bilaterally with no adventitious sounds, no signs of subcutaneous air or tracheal deviation. He was able to speak clearly. Heart sounds were normal (S1, S2, and no murmurs) and no evidence of previous surgeries was found. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nBlood work was normal at the time of presentation (CBC, calcium, phosphate, magnesium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, anion gap, AST/ALT/ALP, and albumin) except for slight elevations of WBC (14.0 \u00d7 109 cells/L), bilirubin (28 \u03bcmol/L), and amylase (185 U/L). Lactate was tested six hours later, revealing an elevated level of 4.1 mmol/L. Chest X-ray was suggestive of mediastinal air () and revealed a left-sided pleural effusion. There was no evidence of foreign objects in the esophagus or free air in the abdomen. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed a rupture in the distal esophagus with oral contrast leaking from the rupture, a pneumomediastinum, and left-sided pleural effusions ().\nTreatment began with cessation of oral intake, administration of IV fluids, morphine, and intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics, and repeat blood work. As the patient was clinically well and did not require emergent surgery, he was admitted under the Thoracic Surgery Team and transferred to a step-down unit. Esophageal gastroscopy was performed revealing a mucosal tear at 40 cm into the esophagus, extending just to the gastroesophageal junction. An esophageal stent was positioned to cover the perforation. Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) drainage of the pleural space was conducted with samples taken for culture. Intercostal nerve blocks were placed and a right-angle chest tube was inserted on the left side.\nAfter 5 days, he developed a fever with increasing chest pain and leukocytosis whilst still on antibiotics. CT scan of the chest showed a mediastinal abscess and right pleural collection. He underwent VATS drainage of the abscess and decortication of the right pleural space.

She also complained of some pelvic discomfort that resembled menstrual cramps, but denied overt vaginal bleeding. Her past medical history was significant for osteoporosis diagnosed twelve years prior. She denied any history of ovarian or adrenal disease. She denied any use of medications. The patient\u2019s age of menarche was at 12 years and menopause at the age of 50 years. The patient\u2019s last Pap smear was a year ago which was normal and she also reported no history of abnormal pap smears. The patient reported three normal pregnancies with uneventful cesarean sections and three living healthy children. Surgical history was remarkable for tonsillectomy and rhinoplasty. She was a happily married homemaker and exercised regularly. Interestingly, she noted an increased exercise tolerance and reported that she could easily double her normal biking routine. She also reported an increased libido. She denied tobacco, alcohol, or intravenous drug use. Family history was significant for hypertension in her mother and cardiovascular disease in her father. The subject provided written informed consent for us to use un-identifying photos of her affected areas. Physical exam was notable for marked facial stubble subsequent to shaving (Figure ) and diffuse terminal hair across her chest and abdomen. There was also some regression in the patient\u2019s hairline (Figure ). There was no acanthosis nigricans present. Physical exam also revealed unique changes (Figure ) in 8 of her fingernails (described below), however the toenails were normal. Cliteromegaly measuring 2 cm was observed on pelvic exam. The remainder of the physical exam was otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory studies showed an extremely high total testosterone and androstenedione level at 742 ng/dl (reference range: < 62 ng/dL) and 339.0 ng/dL (20-75 ng/dL) respectively. Serum DHEA sulfate 174.2 mcg/dL (<15 - 157 mcg/dL), TSH 1.6 \u03bcIU/mL (0.5 - 4.70 \u03bcIU/mL), calcium 9.9 mg/dL (8.8 - 10.3 mg/dL), and parathyroid hormone levels 44.2 pg/ml (11 - 54 pg/ml) were all within normal reference range. The serum estradiol level was slightly elevated at 54 pg/mL (0 to 30 pg/mL; postmenopausal) (Table ). A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a 3.5 cm left ovarian mass with normal appearing adrenal glands. This was subsequently confirmed by ultrasound which revealed an enlarged hypoechoic left ovarian mass of 3.6 \u00d7 3.5\u00d7 3.6 cm, and normal right ovary measuring 1.9 \u00d7 2.1 \u00d7 1.7 cm. Her uterus was normal in size, measuring 5.8 \u00d7 2.6 \u00d7 4.8 cm. But, the endometrial lining was heterogeneous and thickened, measuring at 9 mm. Preoperative and intraoperative consultation with our gynecological oncology team was conducted. The patient was referred for surgical removal of the ovarian mass. Laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, peritoneal washings, and dilation and curettage were performed. At the time of surgery, ovaries, fallopian tubes, and uterine cutterings were sent for intra-operative frozen section pathology consultation. The frozen section of the left ovary revealed features of a \u201csex cord stromal tumor\u201d. The right ovary was atrophic measuring 1.9 \u00d7 2.1 \u00d7 1.7 cm. The frozen section analysis of uterine curettings revealed no signs of atypia or malignancy. Lymph node dissection was not warranted based on preoperative and intraoperative evaluation as well as frozen section histological consultation showing a well-contained lesion within the ovary.\nThe final pathology report revealed a left ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor measuring 2.5\u00d7 2.0\u00d71.4 cm. The tumor was composed primarily of Leydig cells, without well-formed Sertoli cell tubules or cord (Figure A). High-power (40\u00d7) fields revealed primarily sheets and aggregates of Leydig cells in a dense fibrous stroma (Figure B). Sertoli cells were difficult to identify. Immuno-histochemical stains for Keratin 8/18 or CAM 5.2 staining was mixed, strong to weak (Figure C). Both Keratin AE1/AE3 (Figure D) and Wilms tumor gene(WT-1) stains revealed negative to weak staining of Leydig cells and were positive for those considered as Sertoli cells. Negative staining of all cells for Epithelial Membrane Antigen (EMA) (Figure E) and diffuse, positive staining of all the cells for CD99, Calretinin, and alpha Inhibin, (Figure F) was observed, consistent with the pattern for both Sertoli cells and Leydig cells. Peritoneal washings were negative for tumor cells. The patient had a normal postoperative course and was discharged from the hospital on the first postoperative day in good condition.\nThe patient returned for a series of postoperative follow up visits. The first was one week post-surgery and then every three months for a total of one full year.\nInterestingly, careful exam of this patient pre-operatively revealed unique fingernail changes. The patient stated that she observed these changes months prior to presentation in the clinic. The nails looked mostly flat with significant curved concave spoon shaped ends. This was observed in most (8/10) fingers. The changes were particularly impressive in the index and middle fingers on both hands (Figure ). An extensive review of the literature did not reveal similar findings in SLCT cases reported before nor any other female endocrinopathy. It is possible that previous cases of SLCT-induced hyperandrogenemia may have overlooked these nail findings. The only condition that leads to similar findings is iron-deficiency anemia. Although patient hemoglobin levels were always within the normal reference range, detailed iron-deficiency anemia work up was performed (Table ) and was all within normal limits. Importantly, the fingernail changes started to gradually reverse after the curative surgery and normalization of patient hormonal profile (Table ). The post-surgery reversal of nail changes (Figure ) led us to confidently conclude that the nail signs were secondary to hyperandrogenemia. As this was the first association between fingernail changes and hyperandrogenemia, we propose these changes to be named the \u201cAl-Hendy\u201d nail sign.\nSince androgens mediate all their cellular biological effects through its androgen receptor (AR), a member of the nuclear steroid receptor superfamily [], we assumed that the fingernail area must express AR. We then decided to examine this concept ourselves. After appropriate IRB approval from Meharry Medical College, we collected nail bed tissues from healthy female volunteers and processed them for AR immunohistochemistry as described in Materials and Methods Section.", "Question": "What is the patient's HEART score?", "LLM Answer": "0", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "2", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The current HEART Score is 0.\n'history' is missing from the patient's data and so we assume it's value is Slightly suspicious.Based on the HEART Score criteria, 0 points are added for 'history', keeping the current total at 0.\n'electrocardiogram' is missing from the patient's data and so we assume it's value is Normal.Based on the HEART Score criteria, 0 points are added for 'electrocardiogram', keeping the current total at 0.\nThe patient is 63.0 years old.

He had been residing within the USA for the last year and working as a long-distance truck driver. The patient described the pain as a heaviness which sometimes felt sharp and lasted several hours long. He had been experiencing this pain for two days and the pain usually started in the morning and worsened with exertion. On the day of presentation, he rated the pain 9 out of 10 on the severity scale and denied any symptoms of shortness of breath or pleuritic type chest discomfort associated with respiration. He was administered aspirin and sublingual nitroglycerin; the nitroglycerin did not relieve his chest pain and his presentation was worrisome for an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient was completely afebrile and vital signs were stable. Physical examination only revealed some elicited pain with range of motion of his left arm. He denied any alcohol use, tobacco use, or illicit drug use and denied any family history of cardiac disease.\nInvestigations\nHis ECG showed 1 to 2 mm ST elevations in lead I and aVL, ST depression in aVR, mild J-point elevation, and T-wave inversion in leads II, III and aVF (Figure ). His ECG was not entirely convincing of STEMI and his troponins were found to be elevated at 5.97 ng/mL and eventually peaked to 6.24 ng/mL. He was taken urgently for cardiac catheterization and it revealed completely normal coronaries so no intervention was performed (Figures -). There was no evidence of myocardial bridging either.\nGiven his profession of being a long-distance truck driver and traveling, he was tested via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 virus) and was found to be positive. Subsequently, a CT scan was done to rule out pulmonary embolism as the cause of his chest pain since SARS-CoV-2 virus induces a hypercoagulable and thrombotic state in individuals []. CT scan was negative for any pulmonary embolism and revealed clear lungs without any typical respiratory characteristics of COVID-19. This was followed up with a transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and it revealed no wall motion abnormalities and a completely normal ejection fraction at 55%-60% and no evidence of pericarditis or pericardial effusion.\nThe patient's blood work was consistent with biomarkers typically identified with COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2): his d-dimer was elevated at 0.96 mcg/mL, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) elevated at 44 mm/hr, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) elevated at 926 units/L, procalcitonin was negative at 0.04 ng/mL, C-reactive protein (CRP) elevated at 3.3 mg/dL, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevated at 366 units/L, amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) elevated at 379 pg/mL, and mild to moderate liver enzyme elevation with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevated at 89 units/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevated at 152 units/L []. COVID-19 is commonly associated with elevated ferritin levels since ferritin is an acute phase reactant but interestingly, in our patient, the ferritin was within normal limits at 243 ng/mL [].\nDifferential diagnosis\nInitially, STEMI was at the top of the differential given that he had an equivocal ECG and worsening chest pain. With cardiac catheterization revealing normal coronary arteries and no lesion inducing stenosis, myocarditis became the top differential given that he had evidence of myocardial injury with the troponin leak. Cardiac catheterization also ruled out any concern for myocardial bridging as the source of his chest pain.\nManagement and follow-up\nThe patient was managed conservatively during his hospitalization. Interestingly, after his cardiac catheterization, his chest pain resolved and the pain was well-controlled with acetaminophen alone. He was not on any medications prior to admission and was discharged in a stable condition with acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were avoided for the concern of exacerbating myocardial inflammation due to COVID-19.

His oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. He was alert with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 14 but noted to be in severe distress, diaphoretic, and tremulous. His skin was cold and clammy and abdomen was noted to be distended and diffusely tender to palpation. A rectal exam was negative for gross blood. A FAST exam noted moderate ascites. A chest X-ray was performed and was negative for acute pathology.\nRelevant laboratory data on admission included the following: white blood cell count of 7600 per mm3, bands of 38%, hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dl, platelet count of 149,000 per mm3, international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.5, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 213 U/liter, and alanine aminotransferase of 309 U/liter. Initial venous blood gas revealed a pH of 7.23, a venous bicarbonate level of 18 mmol/liter and a lactate of 6.62 mmol/liter.\nDespite four liters of intravenous crystalloid fluid resuscitation the patient remained hypotensive at 75/58. Vasopressor support was initiated with intravenous norepinephrine titrated to a dose of 30 mcg/min and vasopressin at 0.04 units/min with minimal improvement in blood pressure to 94/76. Broad spectrum antibiotics consisting of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam were administered due to concerns for septic shock. SBP was considered the cause of sepsis due to patient's abdominal pain, ascites, and bandemia.\nThe patient became increasingly more confused and agitated and the trachea was electively intubated for airway control. During this time, his abdomen was noted to be more distended. Patient was deemed too unstable for abdominal CT imaging as he was requiring multiple vasopressors. Postintubation he was transferred to the medical ICU for presumed septic shock.\nOn arrival to the ICU after initial stabilization of the patient a diagnostic paracentesis was performed in order to obtain culture for possible SBP. An appropriate pocket of fluid was visualized in the right lower abdominal quadrant. Approximately five ml of bloody ascites was aspirated. Concurrently, repeat lab results reported a hemoglobin level of 4.4 g/dl and an arterial blood gas with a lactate of 12.92 mmol/liter. General surgery was immediately consulted due to concerns for intraabdominal hemorrhage. At the same time the patient's girlfriend arrived to the hospital and stated that the patient had complained of falling in the bathroom earlier that day. General surgery recommended angiogram to locate the source of suspected intraabdominal bleeding. Interventional radiology was contacted for emergent angiogram to evaluate for a hepatic or splenic hemorrhage. Massive transfusion protocol was initiated and intravenous epinephrine was added to norepinephrine and vasopressin due to persistent hypotension. He was transferred to the IR suite.\nThe right common femoral artery was accessed and an angiogram was performed initially finding vague contrast blush in the right hepatic lobe which was empirically embolized with Gelfoam and detachable coils. There was extensive contrast extravasation from the distal splenic artery (). The splenic artery was embolized and angiogram postembolization demonstrated no further contrast extravasation (). Patient's blood pressure increased from 70 systolic to 100 immediately after embolization. On examination post angiogram, his abdomen was tense. Patient was also oliguric therefore, the decision was made to take him immediately for exploratory laparotomy for treatment of abdominal compartment syndrome. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a cirrhotic liver without signs of injury and a two-centimeter grade 1 splenic laceration at the lower pole which was not actively bleeding. A total of nine liters of bloody ascites were evacuated from the abdomen. The abdomen was left open and a Bogota bag was sutured to the fascia.

She has been treated for hepatitis B with nucleoside analogue before the hepatectomy. A pathological diagnosis of moderately differentiated HCC was subsequently established. We followed up at interval of 2\u20133 months after the hepatectomy. During post-surgery follow-up, abdominal ultrasonography detected a 36-mm hypoechoic tumor in segment 7 of the liver. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a 40-mm tumor adjacent to the inferior vena cava (IVC) and right hepatic vein (RHV). The tumor was well enhanced in the arterial phase and washed out in the portal venous and delayed phases, suggesting HCC recurrence (Fig. ). No nodule suggesting HCC was identified elsewhere in the liver. Neither lymph-node swelling nor metastasis to other organs was detected. The following laboratory data were obtained: white blood cell count (3000/\u00b5L), hemoglobin (10.1 g/dL), platelet count (16.5 \u00d7 104/\u00b5L), C-reactive protein (2.98 mg/dL), urea nitrogen (9.2 mg/dL), creatinine (0.51 mg/dL), total protein (6.3 g/dL), albumin (3.1 g/dL), total bilirubin (0.4 mg/dL), aspartate aminotransferase (28 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (30 IU/L), glutamyltransferase (16 IU/L), lactate dehydrogenase (179 U/L), alkaliphosphatase (192 U/L), prothrombin time (115.3%), and indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min (7.0%). \u03b1-Fetoprotein (AFP) (12,371.5 ng/mL; normal range < 10 ng/mL) and PIVKA-II (208 mAU/mL; normal range; < 40 mAU/mL) were both significantly elevated. Considering that the patient was still 20 weeks pregnant, delivery was not viable. However, surgery could not be delayed any longer given the rapid tumor growth, which could likely be associated with pregnancy. After discussion with at a cancer board consisting of experts from the departments of gastroenterology, obstetrics and gynecology, and surgery, as well as obtaining appropriate informed consent from the patient and her family, we decided to perform hepatic resection after abortion. Subsequently, abortion surgery was performed at 21 weeks and 2 days of pregnancy, followed by subsegmentectomy of liver segment 7 under general and epidural anesthesia 6 days later. Mental care for the patient was provided by obstetricians, surgeons, and nurses before and after abortion. After mobilizing the right lobe of the liver, we identified the Glissonian pedicle (G) 7 and injected indigo carmine under US guidance to mark the perfusion area. Thereafter, hepatic resection was initiated using an ultrasonic dissector under the Pringle\u2019s maneuver. After identifying the G7, a clamp test was performed to reconfirming the ischemic area before ligating and cutting it. We continued hepatic resection along the RHV, exfoliated a tumor within the vicinity of a root of the RHV, and subsequently completed subsegmentectomy of liver segment 7 (Fig. ). The surgery lasted 274 min, with an estimated blood loss of 940 mL. Macroscopically, the whitish tumor with a maximum diameter of 4.0 cm was simple nodular type and showed expansive growth (Fig. ).

Abdominal computed tomography (CT) results showed hepatic parenchymal abnormality and a tumor on the left adrenal gland. The patient was transferred to the reporting hospital with these results.\nSeven years prior to presentation the patient had been diagnosed with hypertension and was put on antihypertensive medication, but remained poorly controlled over the 3 years prior to presentation. He was also diagnosed with diabetes mellitus 8 years ago and has been treated with hypoglycemic agents, but his blood sugar was poorly controlled. There was no other medical history.\nOn admission, his blood pressure was 140/90 mm Hg with a pulse rate of 66 beats per minute, was breathing at a rate of 20 times per minute, and had a body temperature of 36.8\u2103. He had clear consciousness without signs of conjunctival pallor, scleral jaundice, dehydration, and absent dilatation of the jugular vein. On chest auscultation breath sounds were clear without wheezing or crackles detected. Cardiac auscultation revealed a heartbeat that was regular without murmur. On examining the abdomen, bowel sounds seemed reduced and the right upper abdomen had slight but not significant tenderness. No masses were detected on abdomen. No limb edema was seen.\nTwo days prior to admission, the patient had been tested in another hospital. Blood tests resulted as follows: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 444 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 469 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 1,153 IU/L, white blood cell count 50,000/\u00b5L, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) negative, anti-HBsAb positive, antihepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) antibody (Ab) negative, antihepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) immunoglobulin M (IgM) Ab negative, and anti-HAV IgG Ab positive. On the day of admission to our hospital, the blood test results were as follows: hemoglobin 15.8 g/dL, white blood cell count 59,360/\u00b5L, platelet count 244,000/\u00b5L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 4 mm/hr, and C-reactive protein 3.446 mg/L, blood urea nitrogen 22.7 mg/dL, serum creatinine 0.76 mg/dL, serum calcium 7.2 mg/dL, inorganic phosphorous 2.0 mg/dL, sodium 134 mmol/L, and potassium 4.4 mmol/L. The results also showed that total protein was 5.5 g/dL, albumin was 2.7 g/dL, AST 156 IU/L and ALT 317 IU/L, ALP 289 IU/L, and total bilirubin 1.05 mg/dL. Hemoglobin A1c was 10.7%. At fasting, C-peptide was 0.40 ng/mL (range, 0.48 to 3.3), and 2 hours after a meal it was 0.66 ng/mL. Lactate dehydrogenase was 1,240 IU/L. Creatine kinase MB and troponin-T were found to be 5.99 ng/mL (range, 0.6 to 6.3) and 0.073 ng/mL (range, 0.0 to 0.1), respectively.\nChest X-ray found no abnormal finding. Abdominal CT at another hospital detected several small-sized and low attenuation lesions on both lobes of the liver, and a 5\u00d75-cm-sized tumor enhanced unevenly on the left adrenal gland ().\nElectrocardiography revealed sinus rhythm with T wave inversion and QT interval prolongation observed in leads II and V1 to V6 (). Although the cardiac ejection fraction was 69%, echocardiography detected severely hypokinetic wall motion of mid-left ventricle sparing basal and apical wall motions.\nThe tumor on the left adrenal gland was tested for hormones. The results of 24 hours urinalysis were as follows: vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) 33.93 mg/day (range, 0 to 8.0), metanephrines 20.45 mg/day (range, 0 to 1.3), epinephrine 2,034 \u00b5g/day (range, 0 to 40), norepinephrine 978 \u00b5g/day (range, 0 to 80), serum epinephrine 1,221 pg/mL (range, 0 to 120), and serum norepinephrine 778 pg/mL (range, 100 to 410). Other tests including aldosterone, plasma renin activity, and cortisol were all normal. On 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scan examination, uptake of the radioactive isotope was increased in the left adrenal gland, but no other lesions were found ().\nBased on the examination results above, the patient was diagnosed with a pheochromocytoma on the left adrenal gland. On the 12th day of admission oral phenoxybenzamine administration was started, and blood pressure was followed after having ceased all previous antihypertensives. The dosage of phenoxybenzamine was increased to 35 mg/day. After 19 days of administration, resection of the left adrenal gland was performed under laparoscope. The size of the resected tumor was 5\u00d75 cm, and the surface was a mixture of a hemorrhagic and a cystic lesion. The tissue pathological examination showed the tumor cells with eosinophillic cytoplasm and polygonal shape surrounded by mesenchyma of vasculature on H&E staining, while immunohistochemical stains of chromogranin, synaptophysin, and S-100 immunoperoxidase staining revealed the proper findings to diagnose pheochromocytoma as positive (). Thirteen days after tumor resection a panel of endocrine tests was performed to follow-up on the pheochromocytoma. A 24 hours urinalysis showed a VMA of 6.51 mg/day with metanephrines at 0.61 mg/day, epinephrine at <5 \u00b5g/day, norepinephrine at 101.48 \u00b5g/day, serum epinephrine at <15 pg/mL, and serum norepinephrine at 536.60 pg/mL (). When first admitted, the patient had uncontrolled blood pressure even with amlodipine 10 mg and irbesartan 150 mg plus 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. However, when discharged, the patient had controlled blood pressure with a reduced dosage of antihypertensives consisting of amlodipine 10 mg and irbesartan 150 mg.\nPrior to his admission to the outside hospital, the patient had no history of new drug administration that might cause liver function failure. He also had no history of drinking and had a normal body weight (body mass index 23 kg/m2). A panel for hepatic viral disease (hepatitis B virus, HCV, HAV) was negative, and no abnormality was found through immunological testing (antismooth muscle, antinuclear, antimitochondria antibody), or screening for genetic diseases (plasma iron parameters, ceruloplasmin, Cu). This led to the challenge of finding a clear cause for the liver function failure. The liver function improved with conservative treatment, and had resolved by the time phenoxybenzamine was administered (). On the 22nd day after left adrenal gland resection, AST and ALT had normalized at 23 and 25 IU/L, respectively (), and normal liver function test remained within normal limits at 80 days after surgery.\nAfter admission to our hospital, the patient's leukocytosis continued, and follow-up tests were performed to examine for secondary causes such as blood diseases, infection, and pheochromocytoma. On the fourth day of phenoxybenzamine administration the white blood cell count had recovered to 5,900/\u00b5L and continued to be within the normal range even after surgery ().\nEchocardiography indicated cardiac ejection fraction of 78% on the 15th day after admission (fourth day of phenoxybenzamine administration), and no left ventricle wall motion abnormalities were observed.\nOn admission the patient was administered insulin and metformin, but the range of blood glucose fluctuation was wide. However, after surgery blood glucose levels returned to the normal range without the previously administered medications. Previously suppressed C-peptide secretion was recovered 3 days after surgery. On the 80th day after surgery, the hemoglobin A1c was measured found to be 5.7% ().", "Question": "What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?", "LLM Answer": "2.13", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "1.76", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Fibrosis-4 is Fib-4 = (Age * AST) / (Platelet count (in billions) * \u221aALT), where platelet count is the number of billions per L, and the units for AST and ALT are both U/L.\nThe patient's concentration of AST is 156.0 U/L.\nThe patient's concentration of ALT is 317.0 U/L.\nThe patient's concentration of platelets is 244000.0 count/\u00b5L.

There was no significant family history. On physical examination, a palpable and hard mass was noted in the right pelvic area. Hepatomegaly, liver masses, and ascites were absent. Initial laboratory findings were as follows: white blood cell count 4,830/\u00b5L, hemoglobin 15.2 g/dL, platelets 138,000/\u00b5L, total protein 7.8 g/dL, albumin 4.4 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 31 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 35 IU/L, total bilirubin 1.0 mg/dL, alkaline phosphate 98 IU/L, prothrombin time 14 second (INR 1.21), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) 15.01 ng/mL, and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) 864 mAU/mL.

They demonstrated a 13\u00d710 cm expansile mass that involved the right iliac bone (). The patient underwent an incisional biopsy with the impression of a malignant bone tumor. However, on pathological examination, the tumor was composed of polygonal cells with ample cytoplasm and trabecular pattern. In immunohistochemical stains, these tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3), hepatocyte paraffin 1 (HepPar1), and glypican-3, which confirmed the diagnosis of HCC (). Tumor cells were negative for CD56, chromogranin A and synaptophysin, which are the markers of neuroendocrine differentiation. To find the primary focus, abdominal CT, MRI, positron emission tomography (PET) scans and angiography were performed. However, no tumor was found in the liver in these radiologic examinations.\nWe diagnosed this case as an isolated metastatic HCC of the pelvic bone without the presence of a primary cancer in the liver. Surgical resection of the tumor was recommended, but the patient refused an operation because of old age and the large size of the tumor. Instead, we decided to treat him with combined modalities. He started radiotherapy in the pelvic area with a total dose of 5,100 cGy in 17 fractions. One week after the end of radiotherapy, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) was performed in the metastatic HCC of the pelvic bone via the right internal iliac artery (adriamycin 50 mg and 20 mL of lipiodol). Then, the patient was treated with five cycles of systemic chemotherapy based on 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU, 1,000 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, and 3) and cisplatin (90 mg/m2 on day 2 every 4 weeks). After the completion of chemotherapy, the tumor became almost necrotic. The AFP and PIVKA-II levels decreased to the normal ranges (2.85 ng/mL and 28 mAU/mL, respectively). As the treatment resulted in near complete regression of the tumor, the patient underwent close follow-up without chemotherapy. However, 12 months after chemotherapy, a CT scan revealed multiple lung metastases in both lungs with increasing AFP and PIVKA-II levels (182 ng/mL and 38 mAU/mL, respectively). He was treated with two cycles of systemic chemotherapy with the same regimen (5-FU 1000 mg/m2 on days 1, 2 and 3 and cisplatin 90 mg/m2 on day 2).

After administering an inhaled bronchodilator with a systemic steroid, intravenous methylprednisolone 40 mg, his oxygen demand gradually decreased to 3 L/min administered via a nasal cannula.\nIn order to find the possible source of the \"hemoptysis,\" computed tomography (CT) of the chest with angiography was performed, which showed a new area of consolidation in the right basal lung suggesting necrotizing pneumonia (). Otherwise, no definite hypertrophied bronchial artery was seen and there was no possible bleeding focus.\nBlood tests showed marked leukocytosis (28,690/mL, 78% segmented neutrophils) with significantly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP, 28.11 mg/dL) and lactic acid (4.3 mmol/L).\nThere was no change in the hemoglobin level from his baseline (12.8 g/dL). His hematocrit was 38.3% and the platelet count was normal (252\u00d7103/\u00b5L). The blood urea nitrogen was not elevated (15 mg/dL); serum sodium was 134 mmol/L and the serum glucose level was 158 mg/dL. Liver function tests were also within the usual range (aspartate aminotransferase, 35 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 40 IU/L; total bilirubin, 1.1 mg/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; and prothrombin time, 64% [patient's baseline, 69%]).\nTreatment with intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g every 6 hours and levofloxacin 750 mg daily was initiated immediately and the patient was admitted to the general ward. Given the relatively mild pneumonia severity index (risk class III, 89 points) and radiologic extent of pneumonia, inflammatory markers including leukocyte count and CRP were persistently highly elevated. There were no improvements in his clinical signs (respiratory symptoms, cough, dark-colored sputum, and wheezing) or X-ray while continuing antibiotics. There was no bacterial growth on the initial blood and sputum cultures. A sputum acid fast stain for tuberculosis was negative. The urinary pneumococcal antigen test was also negative. On hospitalization day 5, his dyspnea worsened and the oxygen demand increased up to 6 L/min via nasal cannula.\nOn hospital day 7, the patient developed type 2 respiratory failure (pH, 7.13; pCO2, 105 mm Hg; pO2, 123 mm Hg; HCO3, 25.2 mmol/L) despite the use of noninvasive ventilator support overnight. Intubation was performed, and immediately afterwards, a massive volume of dark-brown secretions with a consistency like anchovy-paste was expectorated via the endotracheal tube. We thought that it was very strange because his mental status had been alert and there was no preceding aspiration event. Since the huge hepatic mass had been compressing the right lung, we considered the possibility of a connection and reviewed the initial CT scan with the Division of Thoracic Imaging, Department of Radiology. Indeed, a possible communication tract between the hepatic mass and the right middle bronchus was discovered (). A sputum smear was performed which showed numerous neutrophils and dyskeratotic cells.\nThe patient was admitted to the intensive care unit to receive mechanical ventilation and the antibiotic therapy was changed to intravenous meropenem 1 g every 8 hours. Bronchoscopy performed the next day showed obstruction of the right middle bronchus with a large amount of thick brown secretions. No overt defect was seen. After toileting, the patient was successfully extubated.\nIn the ward, he continued to expectorate dark brown sputum despite improvement in the pneumonic consolidation, laboratory findings, and oxygen demand. After 12 days of intravenous antibiotics to cover necrotizing pneumonia and continued administration of sorafenib and entecavir, the chest X-ray showed slightly improved consolidation and a sign of an air-fluid level under the right diaphragm.\nOn the 25th hospital day, a repeat CT scan was taken, which showed simultaneous disappearance of the pneumonic consolidation and the necrotic fluid within the hepatic mass (). A fistula connecting the two sides was seen (). The patient's history was carefully recorded again and the patient and his wife confirmed that there had not been any blood in the sputum at any time; it had always been brown and like the anchovy-paste (). It turned out that an intern in the ED had initially recorded it as \"hemoptysis.\" A sputum smear was performed again and showed numerous bilirubin castlike objects ().\nConsidering the short life expectancy due to HCC, he and his family did not want to receive further invasive procedures or surgery. While continuing antibiotics and tapering the steroid, the patient received inpatient rehabilitation and was successful discharged. We decided to continue antibiotics, sorafenib, and entecavir in the outpatient clinic.

Physical examination and initial vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 37.0\u2103; pulse rate, 66 beats/min; respiratory rate, 18 breaths/min; and blood pressure, 140/90 mmHg. Her height and body weight were 158 cm and 66 kg. She had a 10-year history of hypertension with good blood pressure control from oral Valsartan (40 mg/day). Her familial history was unremarkable. Laboratory examinations showed a low white blood cell count of 3,920/\u00b5L, a hemoglobin level of 11.8 g/L, and a platelet count of 124,000/\u00b5L. The liver function test results were as follows: serum aspartate transaminase: 14 U/L; alanine transaminase: 19 U/L; alkaline phosphatase: 88 IU/L; gamma-glutamyl transferase: 16 U/L; total bilirubin: 4.05 \u00b5mol/L; albumin, 35.7 g/L; and international normalized ratio: 0.93. CA 19-9 and \u03b1-FP were assayed for a malignancy workup, with results of 16.35 U/mL and 2.61 ng/mL, respectively. The results for viral markers including HBV surface antigen and anti-HCV were negative. Abdominal CT revealed an atrophic left lobar and dilated bile duct with the middle hepatic vein close to the cystic lesion (). Abdominal MRCP revealed irregular intrahepatic bile duct dilatation (IHBDD) of the left lobe with the left hepatic duct obstructed, while the common bile duct and right intrahepatic bile duct were normal (). However, we found that the irregular cystic dilatation of the bile duct was limited to the left liver and contained stones inside the cysts. No obvious abnormal dilated bile duct was found in the right liver. The common bile duct and the hepatic duct were normal, and no obvious dilatation was found. This patient was diagnosed with Caroli disease (type V). The surgical indication for the patient was explicit. However, the treatment prescription required consideration of the cystic wall being adjacent to the middle hepatic vein, the left hepatic atrophy and structure disorder, and the observation that the left hepatic vein was not visible. Although complete resection of the cysts may be a curative treatment for unilobar Caroli disease, this treatment was impossible for this patient due to the close adherence of the middle hepatic vein to the cystic wall. Therefore, we decided to perform laparoscopic left LR for the patient, while preserving a partial cystic wall close to the middle hepatic vein.\nThe standard laparoscopic equipment used to perform laparoscopic hepatectomy included a 30\u00b0 5-mm laparoscope, a hook dissector, 5-mm laparoscopic forceps, a 5-mm atraumatic grasper, a 10-mm GIA (Johnson & Johnson Medical, Shanghai, China), 5-mm harmonic (Johnson & Johnson Medical) and 10-mm locking pliers.\nThe conventional fully laparoscopic multiport approach was adopted. The patient was placed in a supine position, and the surgeon stood on the right side. Under general anesthesia, five 5- to 10-mm incisions were made in a \u201cU\u201d configuration. Division of the liver parenchyma was performed with Harmonic or Endo-GIA. Large pedicles were stapled or clipped.\nUpon surgical exploration, the left lobe of the liver was found to be atrophied, and the right liver had developed compensatory hyperplasia with a red-brown and smooth surface. However, the left liver lobe was severely adherent. We gradually dissected the adhesion using harmonic pliers and exposed the atrophic left lobe (5 cm \u00d7 6 cm \u00d7 2 cm). The gallbladder was approximately 7 cm \u00d7 4 cm \u00d7 2 cm in size and was filled with bile and gallstones. Through intraoperative exploration, we confirmed the diagnosis of Caroli disease, limited to the left lobe of the liver. We obtained a biopsy from the edge of the lesion and performed a rapid intraoperative pathological examination to exclude malignant tumor. We then decided to perform a laparoscopic left liver and gallbladder resection. The difficulty was that the lesion was close to the middle hepatic vein. We opened the cysts and resected most of the lesion while retaining part of cystic wall close to the middle hepatic vein. After laparoscopic left half-liver and gallbladder resection, the liver lesion tissue and gallbladder were removed completely from the abdominal cavity. Histopathologic findings showed congenital dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts, confirming the preoperative diagnosis of Caroli disease (). Histopathology of the resected specimen revealed large, cystic dilations of the large intrahepatic bile ducts. This patient was seen regularly every 3 months at the outpatient department.

Necropsy exam revealed the following: about 1700 mL of serous fluid in the right pleural cavity, with gray deposits, which were also present focally on the surface of the right pleura, and about 500 mL of serous citrine fluid in the left pleural cavity. The middle lower lobe of the right lung had a well-demarcated red-gray area, with small violaceous areas of increased consistency, having a dry, granular cross section surface. The adrenal glands showed bilateral medullary hemorrhage. No signs of autolysis were identified.\nGiven the persistence of the suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection, five lung fragments (0.5/0.3 cm) were collected by cutting with scalpel from the red-gray area, middle lower lobe (with collection device produced by Sanimed International Impex, Bucharest, Romania). RT-PCR testing was performed on these lung fragments and the result was positive. Total RNA isolation was performed with NucleoSpin RNA for tissue (Macherey-Nagel, Dueren, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The E gene assay (Envelope gene) was used as the first line screening tool (Ct 23) then followed by confirmatory testing with an RdRp gene assay (Ct 25.3) (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene\u2014inside the Orf1ab polyprotein gene) and N gene assay (Ct 26.5) according to the Charite/Berlin protocol [].\nFor the histopathological examination, we used an Olympus BX40 microscope (Tokyo, Japan) with an Olympus Camedia 4040 photo camera, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) stain (staining kit produced by Laboratorium, Bucharest, Romania), Giemsa stain (staining kit produced by Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), periodic acid\u2013Schiff (PAS) stain (staining kit produced by Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and Grocott stain (staining kit produced in our own laboratory). For immunohistochemistry, CD3 (Dako, polyclonal rabbit anti-human) and CD45 (Dako, monoclonal mouse antihuman, clone 2B11 + PD7/26) were used. The immunolabeling reaction was carried out by an automated immunostainer (Leica Bond-Max, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) using a polymer-based detection system (Leica Biosystems, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidin (DAB) as the chromogen.\nThe histopathological examination of the case evidenced preexisting lesions in various organs, which could be assigned to preexisting morbidities, favoring the severe evolution of COVID-19 infection. The histopathological examination also detected recent lesions occurring in the context of COVID-19 infection.\nIn the lung tissue, a background of lung fibrosis (A), with emphysematous areas (B) and thickened septa with myofibroblasts (C,D) was seen.\nOn this fibrosis background, the large and small arterial lung vessels show many thromboses (). The thromboses are accompanied by subpleural hemorrhagic foci (Tardieu spots, resulting from acute hypoxia), as well as by acute pulmonary edema foci in the rare alveoli unoccupied by inflammatory exudate. In the thrombosed vessels, lymphocytes adherent to the endothelium, with a significance of endotheliitis () but with low intensity, can be seen. In the dilated perivascular lymphatics, there is a cell-rich lymph fluid, with a cellularity similar to that of alveolar exudate (A).\nEosinophilic (A) and basophilic microthrombi (B) can also be observed, which represent aspects of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).\nThe alveolar exudate is rich in foam cells ( and ). Alveolar exudate immunolabeling is positive for the leukocyte common antigen (CD45, a commonly used marker of hematopoietic cells except for erythrocytes and platelets) (A), but negative for CD3 (a common antibody for identifying T cells) (B). Immunolabeling of the innate immune system cells for induced nitric oxide (iNOS) is extremely weak ().\nIn the alveoli filled with macrophages, cystic forms with multinuclear content were also present (B). These proved to be positive by Giemsa stain (A,B), Grocott-Gomori\u2019s methenamine silver stain (C), and PAS stain (D).\nGiemsa stain also evidenced the fact that focally, some alveoli were invaded by a population of filamentous bacteria, in those areas the alveolar exudate having a bronchopneumonic, bacterial superinfection appearance ().\nIn the pleura, the whitish exudate described macroscopically was a mixture of fibrin and basophilic granular material, rich in round cells with vesicular nuclei. These cells were positive by Giemsa and Grocott staining, supporting the diagnosis of pneumocystosis (). Starting from these pleural images suggestive of Pneumocystis, it was inferred that the foamy alveolar material phagocyted by the activated macrophages was probably identical to this basophilic granular material, and the cystic forms described in were Pneumocystis cystic forms.\nThe myocardial muscle fibers are hypertrophied and fragmented, and in the medium intramyocardial venous vessels, rare microthrombi are present (A). In the liver, alcoholic steatosis is seen. In the medium and large branches of the suprahepatic veins, there is inflammatory infiltrate which allows the diagnosis of phlebitis (B).

The child had a normal birth and growth history, and received vaccinations according to plan. Furthermore, the child was breastfed and ate age-appropriate food. The child tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the nasopharyngeal swab in the evening of February 1, 2020, and was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of fever, dry cough and running nose. The patient\u2019s mother also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, and was admitted at the same time.\nThe physical examination at admission revealed the following: body temperature 37.6 \u00b0C (ear temperature), respiratory rate 23/min, pulse rate 105 beats/min, blood pressure 95/56 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa), and SPO2 99%. The child was fully conscious, and had a good response. The skin and mucosa were intact, with no signs of rash or bleeding points. The anterior fontanel was closed. The conjunctivae were clear without exudates or hemorrhage. The sclera was non-icteric. There was mild throat congestion, but no enlargement of tonsils. The patient presented no signs of respiratory distress. The breath sounds were clear bilaterally in all lobes, without rhonchi or crackles. The heart rate and rhythm were normal. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs are auscultated. The abdomen was soft and flat, with no signs of pain upon palpation. No masses, hepatomegaly, or splenomegaly were noted. The neurological examination was normal. The capillary refill was 2 seconds.\nLaboratory examinations were performed on February 2 after admission. The results revealed the following. Nasopharyngeal swabs revealed negative results (colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic method) for influenza A and B virus, respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus. In addition, the influenza A and B virus RNA (PCR method) was also found to be negative.

The chest computed tomography (CT) on February 5 revealed scattered ground glass opacities in the right lower lobe close to the pleura (Fig. a, c).\nThe possible route of transmission was investigated, and the following was revealed. The patient attended a family gathering event together with the patient\u2019s mother and grandmother on January 20. One person who also attended the gathering recently went to Wuhan, but was asymptomatic at that time. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19 on January 28. The child\u2019s grandmother started to present symptoms of fever and minor cough at 3 days after the gathering. She tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in the nasopharyngeal swab (negative results in urine and stool) on January 29, and was admitted to the hospital for treatment. Her chest CT presented signs of viral pneumonia. The patient\u2019s mother presented with a symptom of nasal congestion without fever on January 31, and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in the nasopharyngeal swab on February 1. The virus RNA in stool, urine, vaginal discharge and breast milk were all negative despite the repeated testing. The chest CT indicated viral pneumonia. The patient\u2019s father tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA on repeated tests.\nAfter admission, the patient was treated with 1.5 million units of recombinant human interferon \u03b1-2b by aerosolization, twice daily, during a course of 7 days, and also received other symptomatic treatment. On the second day of admission, the patient\u2019s body temperature returned to normal. The patient continued to have occasional dry cough, but the runny nose and appetite improved. The symptoms were completely relieved on February 8, with the disappearance of fever, cough and runny nose.\nThe test results for SARS-CoV-2 after admission: On February 5 (at 6 days after symptom onset), the virus RNA in urine was negative. On February 6, 7, 10, 14 and 25 (at 7, 8, 11, 15 and 26 days after symptom onset), the virus RNA in the nasopharyngeal swabs were positive. During the same period, virus RNA was also found to be positive in stool. On February 27 and 29 (at 28 and 30 days after symptom onset), the virus RNA tests were repeatedly negative in both the nasopharyngeal swabs and stool.

She had a 2-year history of hypertension controlled by medication, and no history of smoking or alcohol consumption. She had an intermittent cough with white sticky sputum, without any other symptoms or signs. On the same day, the patient was referred to the Fifth Central Hospital of Tianjin. Here vital signs were: body temperature 36.2 \u00b0C, pulse 86 beats/min, respiration rate 18 breaths/min, blood pressure 142/85 mmHg, and she was fully conscious. There was no visible enlargement of her superficial lymph nodes. She had no cyanosis, percussion pain in the sternum, or abnormal respiratory movements. She had coarse breath sounds in both lungs, no pleural friction sounds, and audible inspiratory crackles in the left lung. Heart sounds were strong and regular, with no pathological murmurs in any valve auscultation area. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was 8 ng/ml (normal range 0\u20135 ng/ml) and non-small cell lung cancer associated antigenCYF21\u20131 was 13.31 ng/ml (normal range 0.1\u20133.3 ng/ml). Other biochemical indicators were within the normal range.\nThe patient underwent a series of imaging examinations (Fig. ). Chest radiography on March 11, 2020 showed several nodules in the upper and lower segments of the left lung (Fig. a). Chest computed tomography (CT) on March 12, 2020 showed multiple solid nodules in the upper and lower left lung (Fig. b). The nodules had irregular outlines, with a maximum diameter of 65 mm, and some had a central cavity. A diagnosis of lymphoma was considered. Enhanced chest CT on March 16, 2020 (Fig. c\u2013e) showed multiple \u201ccauliflower like\u201d, soft tissue masses in the left lung, partially fused, with a maximum diameter of 71.3 mm and a CT value of ~ 36 HU. Enhanced CT showed enhancement with a maximum value of 60 Hu. The boundary between the mass and pleura was not clear, and the mass could not be separated from the pleura. There was irregular thickening of the pleura and no enlargement of lymph nodes. A malignant tumor could not be excluded.\nTo clarify the pathological diagnosis, the patient underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous needle biopsy of the left lung under local anesthesia on March 16, 2020. After consultation with our own and other hospitals(diagnostics were performed by Tianjin Fifth Central Hospital, Tianjin Cancer Hospital and Peking Union Medical College Hospital), the biopsy specimen was finally diagnosed as BA according to histomorphology and immunophenotype.\nWedge resection with safe margins may be the best treatment option for BA patients. However, if the lung is full of diffuse nodules, the whole lung may need to be removed, which seriously affects quality of life. Our patient was treated conservatively and followed up regularly. She was discharged on March 28, 2020.Her symptoms were managed through regular normal activities of daily living, strengthening respiratory protection, avoiding respiratory infection, and drug treatment to relieve dyspnea and cough.\nTo clarify the diagnosis, a double needle lung biopsy specimen was removed, 15 mm long, 1 mm in diameter. It was solid and gray white. Microscopically, there were irregular adenoid structures in a background of fibrosis and inflammation (Fig. a). The lesion had a two-layer cellular structure consisting of a basal and luminal layer, and had a lack of papillary structures. The micropapillae occasionally formed by non-ciliated cells germinated and burrowed into the alveolar cavity(Fig. b). The luminal layer was composed of type II alveolar cells and club cells. However, ciliated columnar cells and mucous cells in some flat areas could still be identified (Fig. c).The appearance was similar to adenocarcinoma in some areas, with alveolar destruction and stromal widening. Through careful observation, we found that the main reason for the stromal widening was edema and inflammatory infiltration. Unlike adenocarcinoma, there was a lack of thick collagen fibers (Fig. d). Tumor cells lacked atypia, mitosis and necrosis. A layer of material resembling the basement membrane surrounded the basal layer. The most important feature was a continuous layer of basal cells around the luminal layer.\nImmunohistochemical staining for p63, p40 and cytokeratin (CK)5/6 clearly showed the continuity of the basal cells (Fig. a, b). The luminal cells and some basal cells stained positive for thyroid transcription factor (TTF)-1. The luminal cells expressed immunological markers of the terminal bronchioles (CKpan, CK7, Napsin A and CEA). A small number of mucous cells stained positive for periodic acid Schiff. The tumor showed a < 10% Ki-67 proliferation index (Fig. ).

Two days later the patient presented to the Emergency Department with a two-day history of worsening sore throat, painful swallowing and fever. The patient was previously well, with no history of chronic diseases, recurrent tonsillitis or previous peritonsillar abscess.

Both tonsils were covered with whitish exudate. No dental caries was noted. There was also bilateral, moderately tender submandibular lymphadenopathy. The remainder of physical examination was unremarkable. Blood tests results are shown in Table . Separate swabs were obtained from the surfaces of both tonsils. Next, under local anesthesia, diagnostic needle aspiration of left tonsil was performed by otolaryngologist, during which scanty amount of pus was obtained.

Her chest was clear to auscultation. Antibiotic therapy with cefuroxime (500 mg once daily) for next 5 days was prescribed, as well as pain relief medication with paracetamol. After completing antibiotic therapy the patient presented at follow-up visit to Otolaryngology Clinic. She was afebrile, with normal vital signs. Examination of oropharynx showed resolution of both, congestion and oedema of left tonsil and soft palate. There was no exudate on the tonsils. Cultures of throat swabs and abscess aspirate collected 2 weeks before revealed the presence of Streptococcus pyogenes in all three materials. According to the patient report, left ankle swelling with which she presented to her family doctor, resolved within 4 days. Upon presentation the patient only had moderate pain in the joint. She was consulted by rheumatologist. Her heart rate was 70 beats/min. She did not have a regurgitant murmur. Her chest was clear to auscultation. Antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer was evaluated and proved to be 412 IU/ml (normal 0\u2013200 IU/ml). The level of C-reactive protein was 13,0 mg/L. Control throat swabs were collected for culture, which revealed normal oropharynx flora. The patient was recommended to continue pain relief medication with paracetamol and present at follow-up visit to Rheumatology Clinic after 2 weeks. Her only complaint was persisting slight pain in left ankle joint. The results of physical examination were analogous to those observed at previous follow-up. ASO titer was 503 IU/ml. Control throat swabs were collected and culture yielded normal flora. The patient was recommended to present at follow-up visit at Rheumatology Clinic after 2 months. At that time, she was well. Ankle pain, according to the patient report, disappeared shortly after last visit. The results of physical examination were analogous to those observed previously. ASO titer was 396 IU/ml. Six months after the presentation at Emergency Department, the patient was well, with ASO titer reaching 262 IU/ml. Table summarizes the chronology of clinical findings and blood tests results.\nCultures of PTA aspirate revealed Streptococcus pyogenes as a predominant species as well as Prevotella oralis and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. Tonsil swabs, collected at the time the patient presented with PTA, yielded copious growth of Streptococcus pyogenes as well as normal throat flora, namely Streptococcus viridians, Neisseria spp, and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. Two control throat swabs revealed only normal oropharynx flora. Bacterial species were identified with the use of routine microbiological methods, drug susceptibility of S. pyogenes was assessed using Vitek 2 Compact (bioM\u00e9rieux). Antimicrobial susceptibility results were interpreted according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing recommendations (EUCAST 2013, version 3.1) []. Streptococcus pyogenes strains isolated from tonsil swabs and abscess aspirate demonstrated identical susceptibility patterns. They were resistant to erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline and fully susceptible to all other antibiotics tested. MLSi phenotype (inducible coresistance to macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramine) was detected with the use of double-disc diffusion testing [].", "Question": "What is the patient's Centor Score?", "LLM Answer": "4", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "2", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The current Centor score is 0.\nThe patient is 32.0 years old.

She was diagnosed with pneumonia (based on chest X-ray findings) and was prescribed tosufloxacin 150 mg thrice daily. However, her fever and cough persisted and she developed papules on both legs the next day (); this prompted her to visit our hospital. Lymphoid follicles with a maximum diameter of 9 mm were identified in the posterior pharyngeal wall (). A throat swab was positive for M. pneumoniae (loop-mediated isothermal amplification method), leading to a diagnosis of mycoplasmal pneumonia. The patient was prescribed oral azithromycin 500 mg daily and oral fexofenadine 60 mg twice daily for 3 days. One week later, her symptoms had resolved. An oral tosufloxacin challenge test, performed 2 months later, was negative. Therefore, the skin rash was determined to have been associated with M. pneumoniae infection.\nLymphoid follicles in the posterior pharyngeal wall can occur as a result of viral infections such as adenovirus and echovirus; these can be distinguished by shape from the characteristic influenza follicles as presented by Miyamoto and Watanabe. Although posterior pharyngeal wall lymphoid follicles do not normally occur with bacterial infections, we have presented two cases in which these lesions were observed in association with M. pneumoniae infection. These mycoplasma-associated lymphoid follicles were larger than those associated with influenza and other typical viral infections, which have a maximum diameter of approximately 10 mm. They were few in number, were teardrop-shaped with well-defined borders and exhibited flushing. Five characteristics\u2014diameter, shape, presence or absence of agglutination, and colouration\u2014are used to assess the typical lymphoid follicles seen in cases of influenza virus infection.

Patient\u2019s social history was negative for smoking, alcohol and illicit drug use. Initial vital signs were Blood Pressure 109/68, Pulse 101, Repiratory Rate 16, Temperature 98.1, and O2 saturation of 100% on room air. On exam, the patient was noted to have edema and tenderness to palpation of his entire right neck, with erythema tracking from the superior border of his right clavicle to the angle of the jaw on the right. No induration, crepitus or bullae were noted on the skin.

Given the clinical exam, CT findings highly suspicious for \u201ca gas-forming organism or necrotizing fasciitis,\u201d and his laboratory results, blood cultures were drawn and intravenous clindamycin, vancomycin and ceftriaxone were empirically started. Otolaryngology was emergently consulted and the decision was made to immediately take the patient to the operating room for incision, drainage and washout.\nFollowing nasotracheal intubation in the operating room (OR), the right neck was explored laterally into the retropharyngeal space. Purulent drainage was found to track via an overlying necrotic fascial plane into the parapharyngeal spaces as well as inferiorly into the superior mediastinum. Intraoperative gram stain showed gram positive cocci in both chains and clusters, gram negative rods and gram positive rods.

She was admitted to the hospital due to fatigue, shortness of breath while playing with friends one month ago. Physical examination on admission revealed a systolic murmur in the left para-sternum, trans-thoracic echocardiography showed a peri-membranous VSD extended into inlet septum with a diameter of 12 mm, left to right shunting, pressure gradient via the defect was 20 mmHg, a PDA of 4 mm in diameter. The patient had undergone trans-catheter PDA closure first, and 3 weeks later, TES was performed for VSD repair without robotic assistance.\nPatient was placed in supine position; two arms were along the body, under general anesthesia with single-lumen endotracheal tube. We used a no.6 Knitted Dacron graft (Vascutek Terumo, Bangkok, Thailand) which was connected to the right common FA of the patient with an end-to-side anastomosis. The other side of the graft was connected to the arterial line of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) machine. Superior vena cava (SVC) and inferior vena cava (IVC) cannulae were inserted via internal jugular vein (IJV) and femoral vein, respectively, using Seldinger technique. When CPB was started, the arterial pressure gradually increased to 260 mmHg, we switched to bilateral FA cannulation with an additional 10Fr FA cannula (Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, Minn, USA) (the predicted size was 16Fr) was directly inserted to the left common FA. After having additional femoral cannula, the arterial pressure declined and stabilized at 180\u2013200 mmHg.\nFour soft trocars (Covidien, Hampshire, Mansfield, USA) were placed in the right chest of the patient, included: one 12 mm trocar in the 5th intercostal space (ICS) at the anterior axillary line as the main working port, one 5 mm trocar in the 4th ICS at the mid-axillary line as the second working port, one 5 mm trocar in the 5th ICS at mid-axillary line as the camera port and one 5 mm trocar in the 6th ICS at the mid-axillary line for left atrium sucker. After snaring SVC, we pushed a 16 G Surflo\u00ae I.V. Catheters (Terumo Corporation, Laguna, Philippines) into the ascending aorta through the anterior right chest wall and used it as an aortic root needle. Myocardial protection was achieved by antegrade Custodiol\u00ae HTK solution (Koehler Chemi, Alsbach-Haenlien, Germany) through aortic root after clamping aorta by Chitwood clamp (Scanlan International, Inc, St Paul, MN, USA).\nRight atrium (RA) was opened in parallel to atrioventricular groove, atrial septal was intact, and we punctured atrial septum at the location of ovale foramen to place the drainage of left atrium. The defect was exposed by taking some stitches to hang RA wall to the pericardium. The lesion extended into the inlet septum, some chordae tendineae of septal and anterior leaflets of tricuspid valve crossed the defect. We split the commissure of anterior and septal leaflets to clearly expose the defect. The VSD was closed using artificial patch, continuous combined with interrupted suture (). The RA was closed using two layer of continuous suture after the split in the leaflets and the ovale foramen had been closed. After declamping the aorta, the heart re-beat in sinus rhythm, de-airing via aortic root needle. Extracorporeal circulation was then stopped and the operation was finished with no difficulties. CPB time and aorta cross-clamp (ACC) time were 185 and 150 min, respectively. Echocardiography prior to discharge showed completely closed VSD, no tricuspid regurgitation.

Because of C-reactive protein test showing elevated level and unspecific infiltration detected on chest x-ray, the child had been administered antibiotic therapy, consisting of beta-lactams and glycopeptides. Beside reduced levels of hemoglobin (5.6\u20137.8 mmol/L; normal range: 6.3\u20137.8 mmol/L) and platelets (90\u2013125 \u00d7 109/L; normal range: 206.000\u2013445.000 \u00d7 109/L), laboratory results were otherwise unremarkable. Results of infectious work-up [blood, cerebral spinal fluid and urine cultures, as well as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for respiratory viruses and pathogens for atypical pneumonia] remained negative. Because of the persisting fever, the child was transferred to three other hospitals, recently to a tertiary care hospital, where he was evaluated for immunodeficiency. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was carried out under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation because of declining general condition. Since respiratory functions had deteriorated dramatically, the child was transferred to our institution for ECMO-support (at 4 wk after first presentation). No definite diagnosis existed to that time.\nMedical history taking with the parents revealed an uneventful pregnancy and birth in Germany. The parents originated from the Balkan peninsula. The patient was the first child and the parents claimed to be healthy.\nThe child was unconscious due to deep analgo-sedation (Glasgow coma score of 3/15). The vesical temperature was 40.3\u00b0C, heart rate was 142 bpm, blood pressure was 82/44 mmHg (under continuous infusion with epinephrine 2.0 mcg/kg/min), weight was 7.9 kg (15th percentile, World Health Organization scale), length was 70 cm (30th percentile, World Health Organization scale), SpO2 was 70%. The pressure-controlled ventilation maintained peak inspiratory pressure of 60 cm H2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 12 cm H2O, FiO2 of 1.0, frequency of 40 pm, and Horovitz quotient of 30. The spleen was 5 cm and the liver 6 cm, palpable in midclavicular lines. Our first clinical impression was that of a systemic infection with severe acute respiratory failure and unexplained lymphoproliferation.\nBlood analysis revealed pancytopenia (hemoglobin: 4.3 mmol/L; leucocytes: 2.600 \u00d7 109/L; neutrophils: 800 \u00d7 109/L; platelets: 32.000 \u00d7 109/L), elevated levels of C-reactive protein (194 mg/L; normal range: <5 mg/L), ferritin (1,020 \u03bcg/L; normal range: 14\u2013103 \u03bcg/L), triglycerides (3.58 mmol/L normal range: 0.4\u20131.6mmol/L), and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (30,247 U/mL; normal range: 158\u2013623 U/mL). Analyses of arterial blood gases showed pH of 6.9, pCO2 of 93 mmHg, pO2 of 30 mmHg, and base-excess of \u221211.1 mmol/L.\nInitial imaging with x-ray showed a \u201cwhite lung\u201d () and with ultrasound showed hepato- and splenomegaly. Further imaging work-up, with either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, could not be performed because of the instable situation.\nBone marrow biopsy showed a distinct hemophagocytosis upon cytologic evaluation (). The lymphocyte population consisted of CD3+ of 1,358 \u00d7 109/L, CD4+ of 1,119 \u00d7 109/L, CD8+ of 2,017 \u00d7 109/L, CD19+ of 487 \u00d7 109/L, and CD56+ of 2 \u00d7 109/L. Further immunological studies by fluorescence-activated cell sorting revealed normal fresh degranulation of natural killer cells (14.7%; normal: >10%), and normal expressions of perforin, CD27, SAP, and XIAP on d 7. Microscopy of the patient's hairs showed no anomaly of pigmentation, as would be found in children with Griscelli syndrome.\nThe patient was further evaluated with cultures of blood, urine, tracheal secretion, and stool. Examinations for ova or parasites provided negative results. All serological and PCR tests for viruses (Epstein\u2013Barr, human immunodeficiency, cytomegaly, hanta, adeno, influenza a/b, respiratory syncytial, herpes simplex, corona, metapneumonia, parvo B19, parainfluenza, rhino, and enterovirus) were negative. Also negative were results of testing for leishmania, legionella, aspergillus, Pneumocystis jirovecii, Hemophilus influenza b, and pneumococcus-PCR/immunoglobulins (IgG/IgM).\nAll tumors markers \u03b1-fetoprotein (2.5 IU/mL), neuron-specific enolase (10 ng/mL), \u00df-hCG (0.2 mIU/mL), homovanillic acid (10 mg/g creatinine), and vanillylmandelic acid (18 mg/g creatinine) were unrevealing.\nA positive result from the interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) was the first indication for possible TBC infection on d 12. However, microscopy for acid-fast bacilli (Ziehl\u2013Neelsen stain) as well as PCR testing for TBC in the first bronchoalveolar lavage were both negative on d 6. Further along in the clinical course, PCR for TBC became positive and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid culture returned positive results on d 40. The identified strain of M. tuberculosis was found to be sensitive to rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and isoniazid, retrospectively.\nAfter discontinuation of the ECMO therapy, further imaging was performed. Magnetic resonance imaging of the central nervous system showed a miliary TBC and a computed tomography scan of the thorax revealed a calcified, round lesion consistent with TBC ().\nNormal functional assays virtually excluded hereditary forms of HLH. A secondary form was therefore recommended to be considered, as was a complete diagnostic re-evaluation (infection, tumor, leukemia). The etoposide (VP-16, according to the HLH-04 protocol) was terminated after three doses administered according the HLH protocol.\nThe child presented with severe hypoxia, and respiratory and metabolic acidosis, despite pressure-controlled ventilation and attempts of high frequency oscillation ventilation, both at high inspiratory oxygen level. The decision was therefore made to start veno-venous ECMO immediately after admission of the patient (see ). A 16F Avalon double-lumen cannula (Getinge AB, Gothenburg, Sweden) was inserted in the right internal jugular vein. A blood flow of 120 mL/kg/min was established, which was sufficient to achieve a PaO2 between 85 and 95 mmHg, and a PaCO2 between 40 and 50 mmHg. Ventilator parameters were reduced as much as possible (peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cm H2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 6 cm H2O, and FiO2 of 0.4) to guarantee \u201clung protection\u201d as well as a transcutaneous O2-saturation of >90%. After initiation of the ECMO catecholamine support with epinephrine and noradrenaline (maximum dosage of 0.18 \u03bcg/kg/min) was progressively weaned (until d 12).\nBecause of the fulfillment of criteria for HLH therapy, the HLH-94 protocol was initiated. The boy was treated with dexamethasone at 10 mg/m2 (d 2 to d 12, and reduced/discontinued at d 24) and etoposide at 150 mg/m2 (three doses in total, given on d 2 through d 7 and being stopped upon normal results from the T cell degranulation assay on d 7). Additionally, intravenous immunoglobulin (0.5 g/kg body weight, given on d 2 through d 15) was administered.\nWith the suspicion of TBC, on d 12 (positive IRGA) a 4-fold tuberculostatic therapy was started, consisting of rifampicin at 1 \u00d7 15 mg/kg body weight/d, ethambutol at 1 \u00d7 30 mg/kg body weight/d, pyrazinamide at 1 \u00d7 30 mg/kg body weight/d, and isoniazid 1 \u00d7 10 mg/kg body weight/d). At 10 d after the start of tuberculostatic therapy, there was improvement in the general condition (stable cardiorespiratory situation, rising tidal volumes). The C-reactive protein level declined from 194 mg/L to 5 mg/L on d 28, followed by the soluble interleukin-2 receptor from 30,247 U/mL to 931 U/mL on d 40. After full lung recovery, the ECMO support was able to be discontinued on d 28. The child was extubated on d 33.\nThe boy survived this critical condition. After discharge on d 66, the child was re-evaluated on d 98, d 460, and d 745. During that time, the boy developed frontotemporal hygroma (left side > right side) with spontaneous resolution.

Her BMI was 39 kg/m2; total weight gain was 20 kg since the disease onset.\nA transabdominal and endoscopic ultrasound also did not reveal any pathological findings in the pancreas. Contrast-enhanced CT and MRI scans of the abdominal cavity were then performed. A tumor of the pancreas was not revealed, although a pathologic mass in the sixth segment of the liver was detected ().\nDue to being unable to identify a tumor of the pancreas and the pathological finding in the liver, we made a decision to perform arterial calcium stimulation with hepatic venous sampling (ASVS). The analysis showed increased insulin and c-peptide levels in almost all stimulated arteries. Moreover, the highest and most prolonged peaks of insulin and c-peptide levels were detected at the points of the common hepatic artery and the right hepatic artery (). This became the most important finding for further treatment.\nTherefore, all performed diagnostic procedures (transabdominal US, endoscopic US, CT, MRI and ASVS) could not reveal a pancreatic tumor. However, the lesion of the liver looked like a neuroendocrine neoplasm.\nExplorative laparotomy was then performed. Intraoperatively, the pancreatic texture was soft and surrounded by peripancreatic fat tissue without any signs of atrophy or sclerosis. Visualization and palpation of the pancreas did not reveal any tumor. But a soft encapsulated tumor 4 cm in size was found in the sixth segment of the liver. An intra-operative ultrasound was performed. There were no tumors either of the pancreas or of the liver other than the neoplasm described above.

Drotaverine hydrochloride (40 mg intramuscular) was given to reduce the LES pressure; this markedly reduced the contraction frequency from 7 to 3/min without a significant effect on the amplitude; a subsequent wet swallow increased the frequency to 9/min and also increased the contraction amplitude (Figure ). Significant swallow-induced LES relaxation was still present.\nPneumatic balloon dilatation of the LES was performed uneventfully. The balloon was 35 mm in diameter, 80 mm in length, obtained from EndoFlex Germany. A small amount of blood was seen on the balloon after the dilation procedure. Omeprazole 40 mg iv daily was administered for 3 days. Thereafter the diet was advanced gradually as tolerated. By day 5, liquid meals passed down the stomach without pain.

Her past medical history was depression, and she has been taking duloxetine, a SNRI 60 mg/day (in the morning) and mirtazapine, a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA) 30 mg/day at bedtime for 1 year. Her mental status was stable and these medications was continued until the day of the surgery.\nGeneral anesthesia was induced with propofol, remifentanil, rocuronium, and maintained with propofol and remifentanil. Blood pressure and heart rate were stable during anesthesia, and fentanyl 200 \u03bcg and flurbiprofen 50 mg along with local infiltration of 0.75% ropivacaine 6.4 ml was administered for postoperative analgesia at the end of the surgery. The duration of the surgery and anesthesia were 80 and 123 min, respectively. She emerged from general anesthesia with no abnormal symptoms. As the surgery was performed in the evening, she skipped to take mirtazapine on the day of the surgery.\nOne day after the surgery, the patient took the usual dose of duloxetine 60 mg in the morning. Three to 5 min later, she claimed hot flush, stiffness around her neck and shoulders, and muscle rigidity in the masseter. The blood pressure was 112/78 mmHg, and the heart rate was 77 beats/min at this time. Medical examination showed neuromuscular abnormalities (muscle rigidity, myoclonus, stiff neck, tremor, and hyperreflexia) and autonomic instability (diaphoresis, tachypnea, tachycardia, and mydriasis). Myoclonus seizure had appeared intermittently and repeated mainly on the upper extremities and neck. During the myoclonus seizure, her heart rate and systolic blood pressure had raised to 140 beats/min and over 160 mmHg, respectively. The respiratory rate also raised to 28\u201335/min. She was febrile (37.4 \u00b0C) and complained of anxiety due to the situation occurring to her. Given the neuromuscular abnormalities and recent surgery, malignant syndrome and neuroleptic malignant hyperthermia were assumed and initial dose of dantrolene 40 mg was given immediately, and body cooling was started as well. Blood test revealed no abnormalities including creatine kinase level, thyroid hormone, glucose, and electrolytes. Dantrolene was not effective and anesthesiologists were consulted from the gynecologists for further treatment.\nA diagnosis of serotonin syndrome was made based on the findings that the onset of the symptoms occurred immediately after taking SNRI; symptoms such as clonus, agitation, hypertension, and tachycardia corresponded to the diagnostic criteria (Hunter criteria; Table ) []. Duloxetine and mirtazapine were stopped. Serum levels of serotonin was 4 (normal range 57\u2013230) ng/ml, dopamine 21 (<20) pg/ml, noradrenaline 434 (100\u2013450) pg/ml, and adrenaline 294 (<100) pg/ml. Myoclonus seizures occurred repeatedly, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypertension persisted, and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit.\nClonazepam 1.0 mg (per oral) was given orally for anxiety and hyperexcitatory symptoms, and intravenous landiolol 0.01 mg/kg/min was started to control heart rate. Non-selective serotonin receptor antagonist, cyproheptadine (per oral, 12 mg), was also initiated to decrease intrasynaptic serotonin level through 5-HT blocking effect. Myoclonus had disappeared soon after administration of cyproheptadine and hemodynamic had stabilized. Intralipid (20%) 100 ml was also administrated for its transient ability to draw tissue and receptor bound serotonergic drugs into lipid-expanded intravascular compartment and trap them into a lipid phase. Additional cyproheptadine 4 mg was given 6 h later and 14 h later from its first administration to continue its antagonistic effect. Two days after surgery, the patient was transferred to the general ward. Serum serotonin effect site concentration was 3 ng/ml.

She was a nurse in a medical ward and had no prior history of TB. She was separated from her husband and intended to use donated sperm for her assisted conception treatment. The timeline of interventions is summarized in Table below.\nThe initial evaluation for subfertility (in a different institution) included a diagnostic laparoscopy performed 8 years prior. The laparoscopy had revealed dense pelvic adhesions (\u201ca frozen pelvis\u201d), and an impression of tubal factor subfertility was made. It appears that there was no deliberate attempt to make a definitive diagnosis as to the cause of the tubal disease as no tissue samples or swabs were assessed. She had undergone a pelvic ultrasound scan which was reported as normal and had had a negative pap smear. There were neither further details of this prior evaluation nor a detailed summary from her previous gynecologist.\nShe neither had a history of pelvic pain nor a history suggestive of previous sexually transmitted infections. She did not report any symptoms suggestive of TB, notably fever, night sweats, or weight loss. She weighed 84 kg, was 1.58 meters tall with a body mass index (BMI) of 33. Her blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg and her clinical examination was essentially normal. She had no lymphadenopathy, acne, or hirsutism. Her gonadal hormone profile presented in Table was in keeping with PCOS.\nThe initial high estradiol (E2) levels and the biochemical evidence of PCOS prompted the use of an exogenous progestogen to initiate endometrial shedding prior to baseline ultrasound scan in preparation for an in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle. She received medroxyprogesterone (Provera) 10 mg orally once a day for 5 days but had no withdrawal bleed. Two weeks after administration of medroxyprogesterone, she still reported no withdrawal bleed. A subsequent pelvic ultrasound scan showed normal uterine morphology. Her endometrial thickness was 3 mm with a small amount of endometrial fluid with no focal endometrial pathology demonstrable on ultrasound. Her ovaries had a polycystic appearance with multiple small peripheral follicles. A simple cyst of 4 cm in size was visualized in her right ovary. The ultrasound findings further supported the diagnosis of PCOS.\nEndometrial assessment by hysteroscopy was undertaken in view of the presence of endometrial fluid and the negative progesterone challenge test. Hysteroscopy revealed an atrophic endometrium interspersed with areas of thickened endometrium, with no synechiae, and bilaterally obliterated and poorly visualized tubal ostia. Directed endometrial biopsies were taken. Histology showed endometrial tissue with a normal gland to stromal ratio. Numerous granulomas, with epithelioid histiocytes, plasma cells and Langhans giant cells were visualized in the stroma with some areas of necrosis. A Ziehl\u2013Neelsen stain was negative. A conclusion of granulomatous endometritis possibly TB endometritis was made.\nFollowing the diagnosis of TB, further investigations were carried out. A chest X-ray was normal and an HIV test was negative. Her liver function tests, creatinine, and full blood count were all normal. She was referred to a physician for TB treatment and plans for assisted reproductive technology (ART) were deferred. Treatment for TB endometritis was started by use of a 6-month regimen of antitubercular therapy. An initial 2-month intensive phase of four drugs (rifampicin 600 mg once daily, isoniazid 300 mg once daily, pyrazinamide 2000 mg once daily, and ethambutol 1600 mg once daily) was followed by a 4-month course of two drugs (rifampicin 600 mg once daily, isoniazid 300 mg once daily). In addition, a daily dose of pyridoxine 25 mg was administered throughout the 6 months. Antihypertensive treatment was initiated in the second month of antitubercular treatment. She was evaluated after a week of initiation of TB therapy and thereafter every month by the physician. She was compliant on all her medications and experienced no adverse effects. She reported no menses despite completing the TB treatment. The supervising TB physician did not consider it clinically relevant to re-biopsy after a full course of TB therapy.\nShe maintained her desire for conception and revisited the fertility clinic. A follow-up ultrasound scan showed less evident endometrial fluid compared to the initial pelvic ultrasound scan with an endometrial thickness of 3.7 mm. Her ovaries were still polycystic but the 4 cm right ovarian cyst was no longer present. A decision on a second trial of endometrial stimulation/shedding was made. She received one cycle of low-dose combined oral contraceptive pills but reported no menses. There was no change in endometrial findings on follow-up scan.\nA conclusion of endometrial scarring post-endometrial TB was made. Further attempts at endometrial stimulation were discouraged in view of her very high endogenous E2 and complete failure of response to exogenous steroids. The options of surrogacy or adoption were discussed while further ART interventions were discouraged due to the endometrial damage.", "Question": "Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?", "LLM Answer": "140", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "124", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient's weight is 84.0 kg.

{"Row Number": 328, "Calculator Name": "Maintenance Fluids Calculations", "Calculator ID": "22", "Category": "physical", "Note ID": "pmc-6378717-1", "Patient Note": "A 3-month-old 1.1 kg female domestic short-haired cat presented with a 3-week history of seizure and generalized pain. The cat had been fed on a commercial kitten food. The cat was examined by the referring veterinarian because of its seizures and reluctance to move for 2 weeks before its initial presentation. The cat\u2019s serum biochemistry profile revealed hypocalcemia (total calcium 1.27 mmol/L; reference range 1.97\u20132.82 mmol/L) and high alkaline phosphatase (835 U/L; reference range 14\u2013192 U/l), aspartate transaminase (70 U/L; reference range 0\u201332 U/L), total bilirubin (3.4 mg/dL; reference range 0\u20130.9 mg/dL), and creatine kinase (3470 U/L; reference range 0\u2013394 U/L). Urea and creatinine were within the reference range (Table ). The complete blood count revealed no abnormalities, and the tests results for feline leukemia virus antigen and antibodies against feline immunodeficiency virus were negative. Based on these results, the referring veterinarian suspected that the cause of the seizures was related to hypocalcemia. Therefore, the cat was treated with levetiracetam (20 mg/kg, IV, BID) and calcium gluconate 8.5% (0.5 ml/kg, PO, BID) for 2 weeks, but its clinical condition did not improve.\nOn initial examination, the cat was lethargic and reluctant to move. Her appetite was good, but defecation appeared to be painful. Her family history, including whether the parents and littermates were alive, was unknown. Serum biochemistry revealed that both the total and ionized calcium levels were low (total calcium 1.55 mmol/L; reference range 2.05\u20133.02 mmol/L, ionized calcium 0.74 mmol/L; reference range 1.20\u20131.35 mmol/L). Radiographs showed skeletal demineralization and the presence of abnormally wide growth plates on the long bones (Fig. ). The differential diagnosis for hypocalcemia with skeletal abnormalities includes primary hypoparathyroidism, nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism, renal secondary hyperparathyroidism, intestinal malabsorption, and VDDR. However, the cat had previously eaten a well-balanced commercial kitten food (Science Diet kitten, Hill\u2019s Colgate Japan) before becoming obviously ill, so nutritional deficiency seemed highly unlikely. The levels of parathyroid hormone (Immulyze intact PTH III, Simens) and 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25(OH)2D RIA Kit FR, Immunodiagnostic Systems) were determined as elements of the differential diagnosis of hypocalcemia. The parathyroid hormone level was high (99.7 pg/ml; reference range 8.0\u201325.0 pg/ml), but 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (23.1 pg/ml) was low compared with the levels of healthy cats (Table ). The urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.032 and traces of protein. No bacterial growth was detected in the urine culture. Consequently, VDDR was suspected to be the cause of hypocalcemia and skeletal abnormalities in this cat.\nOn the day after the initial examination, the cat experienced seizures suspected of being hypocalcemic in origin. Slow administration of calcium gluconate 8.5% IV (1 ml/kg) was commenced, and the cat was continuously monitored by ECG, but no arrhythmia was detected. Several calcium gluconate 8.5% (1 ml/kg, IV) treatment stopped the seizures, but neither her total calcium nor her ionized calcium level increased sufficiently. Therefore, the cat was administered 8.5% calcium gluconate (starting dose, 1.0 ml/kg/h) in 0.9% saline solution by continuous rate infusion (CRI) (Table ).\nStarting on day 2, the cat received alfacalcidol (Onealfa Tablets) by CRI of 8.5% calcium gluconate. However, she did not respond well to treatment with the standard dose (0.01\u20130.03 \u03bcg/kg, PO, SID) of alfacalcidol so the CRI of 8.5% calcium gluconate was stopped. The final dose of alfacalcidol was very large, and 1 \u03bcg/kg, PO, TID was required to maintain the cat\u2019s general condition in the absence of CRI of 8.5% calcium gluconate (Table ). On day 16, the cat was discharged from hospital. Radiographs were taken again 2.5 months after the initial treatment was started. The cat\u2019s bone structure was still abnormal, but showed marked improvement (Fig. ).\nThe hypocalcemia, low 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, radiographic changes, and poor response to alphacalcidol led us to suspect a genetic abnormality of vitamin D metabolism in this cat. In humans and cats, type 2 VDDR is characterized by high 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol levels. In the cat examined in the present study, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol was lower than in healthy cats, and a huge dose of alfacalcidol was required to maintain her serum calcium concentration. Hence, we decided to analyze the gene sequences of CYP2R1 (ENSEMBL Gene ID ENSFCAG00000011383) and CYP27B1 (ENSEMBL Gene ID ENSFCAG00000014701) in healthy control cats (2 intact males and a spayed female, all domestic short-haired cats owned by our veterinary teaching hospital staff) and the affected this cat. The feline CYP2R gene contains five exons encoding an enzyme of 501 amino acids, and the CYP27B1 gene contains nine exons encoding an enzyme of 508 amino acids. We designed primer pairs for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the individual exons and the immediate flanking regions of CYP2R1 and CYP27B1. Genomic DNA was extracted from the blood samples with the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen). PCR amplification of the fragments was performed with 20 ng of genomic DNA in GoTaq Green Master Mix (Promega), which also contained the primer pair (10 \u03bcM each) and water, with 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 \u00b0C, 30 s at 55 \u00b0C, and 1 min at 72 \u00b0C (Table ). The PCR product sizes were verified as correct by agarose gel electrophoresis separation, the products were prepared for sequencing using the FastGene Gel/PCR Extraction Kit (Nippon Genetics), and then sequenced by a commercial DNA sequencing service (Fasmac). The sequences from the healthy cats and the affected cat were compared, and although no abnormalities in the CYP27B1 gene were present in the affected cat, we did identify the CYP2R1 variant in exon 5; c.1380G > G/A and c.1386del in this cat (Fig. ). The variant, where T is deleted at position c.1386, causes a frameshift mutation in the gene, resulting in chain termination at the position encoding amino acid 481 in the full-length 501 amino acid protein (p.Phe462Leufs*20). The partial sequence of CYP2R1 exon 5 in this cat has been available in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases under the accession number LC424161. We next searched for the structural information for proteins affected by this nonsynonymous mutation using the protein database HOMOCOS (). The amino acid sequences between human and feline CYP2R1 were almost identical (96.7% identity) and all contact sites with vitamin D3 were conserved (Additional file ). Therefore, we referred an already-known crystal structure of human CYP2R1-vitamin D3 complex (pdb ID 3c6g) []. Two contact sites (amino acids 487 and 488) in the CYP2R1-vitamin D3 complex were missing in the sequence from the affected cat (Additional file ), suggesting that the T deletion in exon 5 of CYP2R1 linked with a remarkable loss of CYP2R1 protein function in this cat.\nAfter the CYP2R1 variant was identified, the affected cat was treated with a standard dose of calcitriol (Caldemin; 2.5\u20133.5 ng/kg, PO, SID), which restored the total and ionized calcium levels to within the reference range. The level of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol at \u2212 80 \u00b0C stored serum sample of initial presentation was additionally measured using a commercial ELISA kit (HVD3 ELISA Kit, MyBioSource). The low level of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (12 nmol/L) compared with the levels of healthy cats (Table ) is likely to type 1B VDDR in humans [\u2013].", "Question": "Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?", "LLM Answer": "33.0", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "4.4", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient's weight is 1.1 kg.

The patient had been suffering dyspnea on exertion for three years. His vital signs were blood pressure (BP) 130\u2013150/70\u201380 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 80\u2013100 beats/min, respiratory rate (RR) 18\u201322 rates/min, and body temperature 36.2\u2103. The patient's oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter (SpO2) while receiving air was 75\u201389%, which was partially corrected to 91\u201398% while receiving 2 L/min of oxygen via nasal prong (VNP). Arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) under oxygen administration revealed the following: pH 7.39, arterial CO2 partial pressure (PaCO2) 44.6 mmHg, arterial O2 partial pressure(PaO2) 65.3 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3\u2013) 26.1 mEq/L.\nDuring induction, both mask ventilation and intubation were difficult (laryngeal view: Cormack-Lehane grade IV). Intubation trials with a 37-Fr. left-sided double lumen tube (DLT) (Mallinckrodt\u2122, Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) and laryngoscopy, followed by a videostylet (Optiscope\u00ae, Pacific Medical, Seoul, Korea) failed. Hence, a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) was used to intubate a single lumen tube (SLT) (ID 8.0), and then the SLT was changed to a DLT using a tube exchanger.\nLeft one-lung ventilation (OLV) was maintained with an SpO2 of 86\u201390% at an inspired oxygen fraction (FIO2) of 1.0 during right-lung lavage. We performed external percussion physiotherapy with an automatic mechanical percussion device (The Vest\u2122 Model 205 [Airway Clearance System], frequency 10 Hz, duration 3 minutes, Hill-Rom, Charleston, SC, USA) rather than manual chest percussion. After right-lung lavage, we resumed two-lung ventilation (TLV) with intermittent suction for 20 minutes (FIO2 1.0). For left-lung lavage, right OLV was started with an FIO2 of 1.0, but it was impossible to maintain SpO2 > 80% (). Therefore, we decided to postpone left-lung lavage until conditions in the right lung improved (). A chest X-ray taken after intensive care unit (ICU) transfer showed no specific findings, including pneumothorax. One day after the lavage, while in the ICU, the patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation, extubated, and transferred to the general ward.\nThree days later, the patient was returned to the operating room for left-lung lavage. The patient's SpO2 was 91\u201396% with O2 3 L/min VNP. We intubated the trachea with a SLT via Glide-Scope (Verathon Medical, British Columbia, Canada) and then changed the SLT to a DLT with a tube exchanger because the previous intubation was difficult. We confirmed breath sounds from both lungs, and right and left lung ventilation during separation through auscultation. The proper tube location was confirmed using an FOB.\nTLV was performed in volume-controlled mode: FIO2 1.0, tidal volume of 400 ml, RR of 15 rates/min, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 31 cmH2O, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. PaO2 was 57 mmHg (SpO2 86%) on ABGA examination. Fifty minutes after induction, we started right OLV in pressure-controlled mode: FIO2 1.0, inspiratory pressure of 25 cmH2O above PEEP 5 cmH2O, tidal volume of 200 ml, and RR of 20 /min. Within a few minutes of starting right OLV, the patient's SpO2 plunged below 80%, so we rapidly resumed TLV and re-confirmed the proper position of the DLT using an FOB. We did not observe any bronchial secretion or obstruction. Right OLV was tried again, but the patient's SpO2 rapidly decreased to < 80% within a few minutes. After resuming TLV, 2.5 mg of salbutamol was nebulized to relieve any bronchial constriction, and 100 mg of hydrocortisone was injected intravenously to improve symptoms. During manual ventilation, we detected very poor lung compliance. In auscultation, the patient's breath sounds from the right lung were very distant and nearly inaudible. Therefore, we suspected he had a right-side pneumothorax, which was confirmed on chest X-ray (). A chest tube was inserted by a thoracic surgeon, and a follow-up chest X-ray showed that the pneumothorax had decreased (). Two hours after induction, lung compliance and arterial oxygenation improved: FIO2 1.0, tidal volume of 450 ml, RR of 18/min, PIP of 24 cmH2O, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. PaO2 improved to 93 mmHg on the following ABGA examination ().\nWe re-tried right OLV and were finally able to maintain SpO2 > 90%: FIO2 1.0, inspiratory pressure of 23 cmH2O above PEEP 5 cmH2O, tidal volume of 320 ml, and RR of 20 /min, without any severe air leakage or tidal-volume loss. The left-lung lavage was started along with right OLV with the chest tube inserted state. During the remaining lavage period, we maintained SpO2 > 85% without further deterioration.\nAfter lavage, the patient was transferred to the ICU and received mechanical ventilation. On postoperative day (POD) 1, the patient developed a high fever (38.8\u2103) and was diagnosed as having pneumonia with parapneumonic effusion in the right lower lobe, so antibiotics were administered. The chest tube was removed on POD 3, and extubation was performed on POD 4. The patient was transferred to the general ward on POD 7 and discharged on POD 19.

From October 2008 to March 2010, the patient had a dramatic deterioration of her pulmonary functional tests with a chronically persistent septic status and intermittent fever. During this period, apart from P. aeruginosa (resistant to all antibiotics except colistin), a colistin-resistant Gram-negative bacterium was isolated seven times from Cepacia agar. P. pulmonicola was eventually identified by routine analysis by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization\u2013time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) [] and confirmed with 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis (99.9% of similarity with GenBank accession number AF139175) (Strain 9405935, Fig. ).

Initial blood pressure was 170/85 mmHg, heart rate 67 beats/min, oxygen saturation 97%, and body temperature 36.0\u2103. Thiopental 250 mg, lidocaine 40 mg, and rocuronium 40 mg were administered intravenously. Endotracheal intubation was done successfully without complication. After intubation, the lung sound on both lung fields was remarkable and tube was fixed at 21 cm. For maintenance of anesthesia, oxygen 2 L/min, N2O 2 L/min, sevoflurane (1.2-2.0 vol%) were administered, and remifentanil was continuously infused 0.1-0.2 \u00b5g/kg/min. Volume-control ventilation was maintained with a tidal volume of 450 ml, with respiration rate of 12/min. Airway pressure was maintained to 20 cmH2O, whereas partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO2) was kept to 35-38 mmHg. When one hour passed after induction, PETCO2 was reduced to 32 mmHg and tidal volume and respiration rate were controlled to 450 ml and 10/min respectively. Airway pressure was maintained to 19 cmH2O.\nThe patient's position during surgery was a beach chair position. Blood pressure and heart rate were maintained 100-130/60-80 mmHg and 54-85 beats/min, respectively; there were no remarkable events throughout the entire surgical procedure. After the surgery, pyridostigmine 15 mg and glycopyrrolate 0.4 mg were given for reversal of muscle relaxation.

The first episode was a sudden onset of complete paralysis below distal thigh, and he had no other symptoms except leg paralysis. At a local clinic, physical examination revealed symmetric hyporeflexia in both lower extremities. Laboratory analysis revealed mild hypokalemia as below: Na+, 146 mmol/L; K+, 2.7 mmol/L; Cl-, 110 mmol/L; tCO2, 25 mmol/L without abnormality of blood gas analysis. Electrocardiogram showed only sinus tachycardia without atrioventricular block or prominent U wave. However, further evaluation for hypokalemia was not taken, even though there was a suggestion of hypokalemic paralysis, and the patient was just advised to eat an adequate dietary supplement of potassium rich food without any medication by the local clinic. After two weeks, a second episode of leg weakness occurred after morning meal. The muscle weakness was initially subtle but progressed in paralysis below knee and lasted for 6 hours. Thus, he was referred to our hospital. However, the patient visited our clinic the next day, when the paralysis had already subsided.\nThere was no past history or family history of neuromuscular disease and endocrinologic disease, except for his aunt's hypothyroidism. His appearance was reasonably healthy. His height was 168 cm, his weight was 60 kg, and his body mass index was 21.2 kg/m2. His blood pressure was 110/80 mmHg, his respiratory rate was 18 breaths/min, and his body temperature was 36.8\u2103. He had mild tachycardia with a heart rate of 100-110 beats/min,, but he had no palpitations. Neurological examination findings, including deep tendon reflex and cerebellar function test, were normal. The laboratory findings showed normal complete blood cell counts, normal electrolytes as below: Na+, 140 mmol/L; K+, 4.4 mmol/L; Cl-, 104 mmol/L; tCO2, 24 mmol/L. The laboratory findings also showed his normal liver, kidney and cardiac functions. His urine K+ excretion rate was normally low as 0.96 of urine K+/Cr ratio (range, 0-2). There were no abnormal laboratory findings to suggest adrenal hormone excess or primary hyperaldosteronism: adrenocorticotropic hormone, 40.11 pg/mL (range, 3.5-13.2 pg/mL); cortisol, 8.7 \u00b5g/dL (range, 5.0-23.0 \u00b5g/dL); 17 hydroxyprogesterone, 2.68 ng/mL (range, 0.6-3.42 ng/mL); aldosterone, 180.29 pg/mL (range, 38.9-306.8 pg/mL); renin, 6.13 ng/mL/hr (range, 1.31-3.95 ng/mL/hr); epinephrine, 0.030 ng/mL (range, 0-0.30 ng/mL); norepinephrine, 0.087 ng/mL (range, 0-0.80 ng/mL).

Serum TSH receptor antibodies were high at 6.05 IU/L (range, 0-1.75 IU/L), thyroid stimulating antibody was positive, and thyroid ultrasonography revealed diffuse enlarged thyroid and increased vascularity. These findings were consistent with Graves' disease as etiology of his hyperthyroidism. He was initially treated with lower dose of an antithyroid drug (methimazole 5 mg once daily) than usual, since his thyrotoxic symptoms and signs were absent, and his level of serum fT4 was not prominent. In addition, a \u03b2-adrenergic blocker (propranolol) was simultaneously used for preventing the paralysis. After two weeks, a follow-up TFT revealed aggravated hyperthyroidism, and he was treated with increased dose of antithyroid drugs.

The patient had no other remarkable medical or familial history. There was no occupational history indicating exposure to organic solvents (e.g., benzene).\nThe patient started binge eating and purging at 14 years of age. At 16 years of age, she was diagnosed with AN, and had multiple hospitalizations in this regard. The patient\u2019s first admission to our department was at 26 years of age, at which time her body mass index (BMI) was 9.5 kg/m2 (weight, 22 kg; height, 152 cm). The patient had mild, transient bicytopenia with a low white blood cell (WBC) count (3000 cells/\u03bcL; reference range, 4000\u20139000 cells/\u03bcL) and a low hemoglobin (Hb) level (10.3 g/dL; reference range, 12.0\u201315.2 g/dL). These abnormalities improved with nutritional therapy. At the time of discharge, the patient\u2019s weight had improved, with a BMI of approximately 17 kg/m2.\nAt 32 years of age, the patient\u2019s binge eating and purging behavior worsened again, and she began to lose weight. Five months prior to her eventual hospitalization (BMI, 15.0 kg/m2), no hematological abnormalities were identified. At 46 days prior to the hospitalization, because of ongoing fatigue, she was examined by a hematologist at our hospital. The patient was determined to be underweight, with a body weight of 31.9 kg and a BMI of 13.8 kg/m2. Peripheral blood analysis confirmed pancytopenia with the following findings: low WBC count, 2500 cells/\u03bcL; low neutrophil count, 1010 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 1600\u20135400 cells/\u03bcL); low eosinophil count, 0 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 80\u2013610 cells/\u03bcL); low basophil count, 30 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 0\u2013180 cells/\u03bcL); normal lymphocyte count, 1280 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 1060\u20134190 cells/\u03bcL); normal monocyte count, 200 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 90\u2013690 cells/\u03bcL); low reticulocyte count, 14.4 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 35.0\u2013125.0 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL); low Hb level, 6.1 g/dL; high mean corpuscular volume, 113.9 fL (reference range: 80.0\u2013100.0 fL); and low platelet (Plt) count, 10.6 \u00d7 104 cells/dL (reference range: 11.7\u201332.9 \u00d7 104 cells/dL). Blood biochemistry studies showed low serum levels of folate (3.0 ng/mL; reference range: 4.0\u201319.9 ng/mL) but normal serum levels of iron and vitamin B12. The etiology of pancytopenia was tentatively suspected to be folate deficiency, and thus the patient was prescribed folate at 10 mg/day. At 28 days prior to hospitalization, the folate level had recovered within normal limits, but the peripheral blood counts had worsened (low WBC count, 2200 cells/\u03bcL; low Hb level, 2.5 g/dL; and low Plt count, 8.6 \u00d7 104 cells/dL).\nThe patient was temporarily admitted to the hematology department of our hospital for blood transfusions. Laboratory tests yielded negative results for autoimmune disorders (including systemic lupus erythematosus), malignant lymphoma, infectious diseases, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and hypersplenism. The patient was offered nutritional therapy to improve her weight but she refused and was therefore discharged following blood transfusions. After discharge, outpatient follow-up was performed by the hematology department. However, the patient\u2019s hematologic condition did not improve. Despite receiving blood transfusions twice monthly, the patient was eventually hospitalized once again for severe anemia. The patient believed that her hematological problems were not related with her eating behavior and persistently refused nutritional therapy. Finally, she was admitted to the psychiatric department to receive both hematologic and psychiatric support.\nOn admission, the patient\u2019s body weight was 30 kg and BMI was 13.0 kg/m2. The vital signs were normal. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities other than bilateral non-pitting edema of the lower legs. The patient received folate (10 mg/day), sertraline (50 mg/day), zolpidem (10 mg/day), and flunitrazepam (2 mg/day). Toxicology analysis was not performed because the patient presented no feature indicating exposure to toxic compounds. Laboratory findings were as follows: low WBC count, 2100 cells/\u03bcL; low reticulocyte count, 9.4 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL; low Hb level, 5.7 g/dL; and low Plt count, 4.1 \u00d7 104 cells/dL. The differential WBC count was normal. Serum levels of iron, folate, vitamin B12, zinc, copper, and ceruloplasmin were within normal ranges. These results did not identify the etiology of the hematological problems. The patient persistently refused nutritional therapy and hoped that some other causes of pancytopenia (other than malnutrition) would be found. On hospitalization day 7, upon obtaining written informed consent from the patient, we performed bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.\nBone marrow aspiration revealed low counts of nucleated cells (5.5 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL; reference range: 100\u2013200 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL) and megakaryocytes (< 15.6 cells/\u03bcL; reference range: 50\u2013150 cells/\u03bcL). Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypoplasia but no dysplasia and confirmed the presence of fatty replacement with no gelatinous material (Fig. ). It was notable that the bone marrow displayed fatty marrow findings without any evidence of GMT, which would generally indicate IAA. Moreover, no chromosomal abnormalities or cell surface abnormalities were found upon bone marrow examination. T1-weighted images from thoracolumbar magnetic resonance imaging confirmed homogenous high signal intensity, characteristic of fatty marrow. Detailed examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow findings indicated IAA. However, despite the absence of bone marrow features typically seen in malnutrition, the patient\u2019s hematological abnormalities manifested after a decrease in body weight. Thus, although the biopsy findings indicated IAA, we considered that the nutritional etiology of pancytopenia could not be thoroughly ruled out.\nAfter bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, the patient accepted nutritional therapy. At the time of admission, she was given 600 kcal/day intravenously. Energy intake was gradually increased, and the patient received oral nutrition amounting to 3200 kcal/day from hospitalization day 14 until discharge. The patient\u2019s caloric intake was strictly managed, which resulted in weight restoration (Table ). The hematological abnormalities began to improve with the gradual increase in caloric intake. By hospitalization day 11, the patient\u2019s condition had improved to the point where she no longer required transfusions. On hospitalization day 28, the patient\u2019s weight was 38.1 kg, and her BMI was 16.5 kg/m2. Pancytopenia had also improved (Table ), and thus the patient was discharged the following day. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed 2 weeks after discharge yielded normal findings. Because both blood and bone marrow findings improved after implementation of nutritional therapy alone, the final diagnosis was pancytopenia secondary to malnutrition.", "Question": "Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?", "LLM Answer": "38.4", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "78.1", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient's weight is 38.1 kg.

The patient had undergone a tonsillectomy under general anesthesia 8 years previously without any perioperative complication. The medical history indicated no drug or food allergies. Preoperative examinations of the patient were within normal limits. Therefore, anesthesia was applied according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification 1.\nThe patient received no premedication prior to admission to the operating theater. The blood pressure upon arrival in the operating theater was 158/76 mmHg, with a heart rate of 80 beats/min (BPM), and with a peripheral oxygen saturation of 99% of room air. Anesthesia was induced using an injection of 50 \u00b5g fentanyl, 150 mg propofol and 50 mg rocuronium. Endotracheal intubation was performed using a cuffed oral right-angle endotracheal tube. Anesthesia was maintained using oxygen, air and desflurane. As a prophylactic antibiotic, 1 g cefazoline was administered intravenously immediately after completion of induction.\nOne hour after commencing surgery, the surgeon requested a reversal of the neuromuscular blockade to monitor patency of the facial nerve. Anesthesia was consequently maintained using desflurane alone. At this time, the blood pressure was 105/74 mmHg and the heart rate 92 BPM. We administered 1 mg atropine and 1.5 mg neostigmine intravenously to reverse neuromuscular blockade. After approximately 5 min, the blood pressure was decreased to 75/42 mmHg and the heart rate was 104 BPM. We administered 10 mg ephedrine intravenously. After 5 min, the blood pressure was 67/36 mmHg and the heart rate was 94 BPM. To manage persistent hypotension, 200 \u00b5g phenylephrine were administered, followed by a rapid infusion of lactated Ringer's solution. However, the non-invasive blood pressure decreased further to 57/36 mmHg and the heart rate rose to 138 BPM. As we asked the surgeon, there was no drug administration at surgical field.\nInvasive blood pressure monitoring was applied to the left dorsalis pedis artery and additional venous access was established. The arterial blood gas analysis showed all parameters to be within normal limits. Continuous infusion of norepinephrine at 0.03 \u00b5g/kg/min was initiated. Consequently, the blood pressure was restored to 99/51 mmHg and surgery was resumed.\nBecause the patient was covered with a drape, clinical manifestation of anaphylaxis, including skin rash, could not be observed. Approximately 1 h after the hypotension event, a skin rash was detected over the entire body. There were no respiratory symptoms, including wheezing or increased airway pressure. The patient was suspected to be suffering from an anaphylactic reaction. A 10 \u00b5g bolus of epinephrine was given and a continuous epinephrine infusion was initiated at 0.03 \u00b5g/kg/min. The patient responded to the epinephrine and soon maintained hemodynamic stability; with a blood pressure of 110/52 mmHg and a heart rate of 78 BPM. Norepinephrine infusion was discontinued and epinephrine infusion was tapered to maintain the restored blood pressure. The patient was treated using 4 mg chlorpheniramine together with 5 mg dexamethasone to prevent delayed reactions and halt any further histamine release. After 1.5 h, the blood pressure was 110/46 mmHg without any inotropic or vasopressor support. The skin lesion was improved and no respiratory symptoms were detected throughout the completion of the surgery. The total operation time was 200 min and the anesthesia time 245 min. The total infused crystalloid, colloid, estimated blood loss and urine output were 1,300 ml, 500 ml, 50 ml, and 450 ml, respectively ().\nThe patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for close monitoring and was placed on ventilatory support.

Additionally, the patient had developed a left lateral neck mass which progressively increased in size over the past 9 months. Patient denied tenderness to palpation of the mass and dysphagia. His past medical history was significant for papillary carcinoma of the thyroid, GERD, chronic hepatitis C, polycystic kidney disease (PKD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). His past surgical history was remarkable for thyroid malignancy treatment with radioactive iodine and total thyroidectomy in addition to a gunshot wound. Family and social history were not significant. On physical exam, a left supraclavicular soft tissue mass 6 cm in diameter was appreciated, it was non-tender with no submandibular lymphadenopathy. A soft tissue mass was also palpable on the anterior abdominal wall in the epigastric region.\nGiven the patient's malignant history, significant weight loss in the past 3 weeks with increasing left mass size, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, the patient was admitted for further evaluation. Initial studies included ultrasound of the abdomen for workup of acute pancreatitis with findings unremarkable for the body of the pancreas and the head and tail not being visualized. CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed pulmonary nodules in the posterior segment of the right lower lobe of the lung and bronchiectasis of the left lower lobe, PKD and bilateral hepatic cysts. Oncology was consulted, and a CT of the chest and neck were ordered in addition to a chest X-ray that was remarkable for two pulmonary nodules with an enlarged paratracheal node. Pulmonology was consulted, and the patient was recommended to follow-up in 6 months for surveillance of the pulmonary nodules. ENT and Surgery were consulted, and an excisional lymph node biopsy was pursued due to suspicion of possible recurrence of previous thyroid malignancy or metastases (). Histopathology revealed metastatic mucin-producing adenocarcinoma. Immunoperoxidase studies performed on paraffin sections revealed the neoplastic cells were positive for CK20 and CDX2. The cells were negative for CK7, TTF-1, p63, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostatic acid phosphatase (PACP), chromogranin, synaptophysin and S-100. Gastroenterology was consulted, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed including an antral biopsy of the gastric mucosa, which was unremarkable. Colonoscopy of the lower GI tract revealed a 6 cm obstructing mass in the transverse colon and a biopsy was taken revealing findings of invasive well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with mucinous features, focally present in subserosal tissue with ten of eleven regional lymph nodes involved.

Impaired growth was noted (weight 39.5 kg; height 146 cm; BMI 17.6 kg/m). She had a heart rate of 78 beats per minute, blood pressure of 226/136 mmHg, respiration rate of 16 breaths per minute and arterial oxygen saturation of 96%. Blood analysis showed a serum creatinine level of 10.97 mg/dl (nv 0.5-1.1) and urea 109 mg/dL (nv 16-46) mmol/L. The patient also presented with bilateral AMLs, hypertension and seizure disorder. Her relatives reported difficulty in managing her home medications (antihypertensive and antiepileptic drugs) due to her intellectual disability. The patient had been diagnosed with TSC in childhood; there was a paternal family history of TSC. Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) in end-stage renal failure appeared four years prior and the patient has been undergoing peritoneal dialysis since the diagnosis. At the age of 18 years, she underwent a prior unilateral endovascular embolization to treat renal aneurisms and the procedure successfully stopped a bleeding aneurism at the upper pole of the right kidney. Based on the patient\u2019s medical history, clinical and biochemical findings, a ruptured renal artery aneurysm was diagnosed. An urgent renal AE was considered the treatment of choice to limit hemorrhage and the risk of damage to the peritoneal dialysis catheter. The multidisciplinary team, including pediatric surgeons, interventional radiologists, pediatric nephrologists and psychologists agreed upon the choice to perform a bilateral renal AE in this complex patient. Prior to the intervention, and after being informed on the nature of the intervention, the patient and the patient\u2019s parents gave their written consent to undergo endovascular treatment. Under general anesthesia, ultrasound-guided right femoral common artery access was gained using a Terumo 6 FR 11 cm catheter. A diagnostic plain angiography scan revealed a double right renal artery. The major artery was easily catheterized with a 6 FR C2 Mac Boston-Scientific 6 F (65 cm) catheter. Through this catheter, a AMplatzer Plug-2 10 mm was released achieving artery occlusion (about 1 cm from the ostium, ). A Sim1 Boston-Scientific 5 fr was positioned in the lower right renal artery and several Terumo Azur coils were released (). Upon completion of the intervention, angiography confirmed the complete embolization of the vessels (). The same procedure was used for the left renal embolization using a Cobra C2 catheter and Terumo 4x10 mm Azur coils (). With the final angiography, bilateral renal arterialthrombosis was confirmed (about 1 cm from the ostium, ). The first cm of the renal artery was preserved to facilitate clamping during the future nephrectomy. After the procedure, the patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit of our institution for observation and subsequently to the pediatric nephrology unit. Vital signs were monitored; her postoperative course was uneventful. Two months later, the patient underwent a bilateral lumbotomy and bilateral extraperitoneal nephrectomy to protect the peritoneal surface area and dialysis adequacy. Grossly, both kidneys were enlarged (left 14.5x7x6 cm; right 15x5x5.5 cm); macroscopically the tissue was almost entirely replaced by cysts alternating with solid grey and brown areas, on a background of soft and yellowish tissue with calcific deposits. Histologically, solid areas on the yellowish background were revealed to be angiomyolipoma, which extended to the adipose tissue, perirenal and the renal pelvis. Partially solid aspects (epithelioid angiomyolipoma) and partially cystic aspects (cysts with cubic or hobnail epithelium) were observed. In the right kidney, other solid greyish areas were observed (maximum diameter 15 mm); these were classified as renal cell carcinomas (RCC), with acinar, papillary and alveolar growth patterns and cribiform aspects, Furhrman grade III ().

Consequently, three years later, she underwent open surgical revision which was converted to an open RYGB with concomitant cholecystectomy. She had lost over 100 kg since the first bariatric procedure (166 kg preoperatively to 63 kg on presentation). However, she developed multiple complications, including chronic lower extremity lymphedema, small bowel obstruction requiring multiple surgical interventions, malabsorption secondary to short bowel syndrome, multiple vitamin deficiencies, wet beriberi requiring chronic thiamine replacement, osteoporosis causing a left hip fracture, and chronic low back pain.\nIn July 2018, she initially presented to the emergency department with increasing lower extremity edema secondary to chronic lymphedema.

A chest x-ray disclosed no cardiomegaly, pulmonary congestion or pleural effusion. Her last echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 60% with no wall motion abnormalities.\nDuring the admission, the patient received intravenous bumetanide with significant improvement. However, she developed waxing and waning episodes of confusion, and on day 3 of her hospitalization became overtly encephalopathic. She was disoriented to person, time, and space, with bizarre affect as well as incoherent speech, unable to recognize her close relatives. On physical exam patient was lethargic and had asterixis.

Due to altered mental status, he was intubated and was subsequently transferred to our medical facility. On route, for the treatment of hyperkalemia, he was given 3 ampoules of sodium bicarbonate, calcium gluconate, kayexalate, and insulin with dextrose water.\nSix hours after the incident, the patient was more alert and oriented and his leg pain had subsided. Details of smoking history could not be obtained due to the intubation. On physical examination, temperature was 35.8\u00b0C, heart rate 107 bpm, blood pressure 137/94 mm Hg, and respiratory rate 14 breaths/minute. He had regular heart rhythm, no murmur or pericardial rub. His abdomen was soft with active bowel sound. There were no symptoms and signs of limb ischemia on admission. He had no leg pain, pallor, poikilothermia, pulselessness, paresthesia, or paralysis. Motor power was at least grade 4 in all 4 extremities. His dorsalis pedis pulse was 2+ bilaterally.

Urinalysis showed white blood cell 5 to 10/high-power field, red blood cell 0 to 3/high-power field, moderate blood but negative for urine myoglobin. Coagulogram showed prothrombin time 17.5 seconds, partial thromboplastin time 25.8 seconds, and international normalized ratio 1.59. Calculated fractional excretion of sodium and urea were 2.11% and 43.67%, respectively, consistent with acute tubular necrosis.

Computed tomography of head was performed and showed chronic right basal ganglion infarct. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed and showed severely depressed left ventricular function with ejection fraction of less than 20%, grade II/IV diastolic dysfunction with mild TR, mild MR, and mild PR. Akinesis of the septal wall and hypokinesis of the anterolateral wall were present. Moreover, computed tomography of abdomen, pelvis, and chest without contrast revealed right lower lung consolidation with small right pleural effusion, moderately bilateral nonspecific perinephric fat stranding, submucosal fatty infiltration, and mild wall thickening of the descending colon down to the rectum. Subtle perirectal fat stranding was also visualized. Initially, he was treated with empiric antibiotics for possible pneumonia with severe sepsis with piperacillin-tazobactam, levofloxacin, and vancomycin.

The patient had history of old pulmonary tuberculosis, a cataract operation 10 years ago and several orthopedic surgeries for the fracture of both lower extremities due to a traffic accident 20 years ago. The patient had no diabetes, and hypertension. Familial history was unremarkable. Smoking history was 40 pack years, and the patient stopped smoking 12 years ago. He had 135 g of daily alcohol (three bottles of raw rice wine) consumption for 30 years. Alcohol intake was discontinued four years ago.\nChronic ill appearance, drowsy mental status, crusts and bruises of lower extremities, and abdominal distension without fluid wave shifting were noted on physical examinations. The patient did not complain of claudication ordinarily. His cirrhosis status was Child-Pugh B without ascites and hypersplenism-related pancytopenia. The initial vital signs were blood pressure 150/70 mmHg, heart rate 64 beats/min, respiration rate 20 breaths/min, and body temperature 36\u2103. The initial laboratory evaluation revealed WBC 26240 (poly: 85.6%) cells/\u00b5L, hemoglobin 11.3 g/dL, platelet 1.76\u00d7105 cells/\u00b5L, prothrombin time 14.7 seconds, international normalized ratio 1.26 (71%), ammonia 168 \u00b5mol/L, blood urea nitrogen 27.3 mg/dL, creatinine 3.16 mg/dL, albumin 2.83 g/dL, total bilirubin 2.11 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 34 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 16 U/L, \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase 18 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 220 IU/L, lactate dehydrogenase 605 IU/L, Na 137 mEq/L, K 4.7 mEq/L, Cl 114 mEq/L, HCV RNA 1.9\u00d7105 copies/mL and metabolic acidosis. Urine sodium was 61 mEq/L with no proteinuria. Chest X-ray showed mild cardiomegaly and emphysematous change. Non-enhanced abdominal CT was unremarkable. Before admission, he had difficulty in defecation for 4 days. The first impression was grade III (graded with the West Haven Criteria) hepatic encephalopathy caused by constipation. Lactulose enema and administration of empirical antibiotics for infection of unknown origin related to leukocytosis were applied. And six months previously, his creatinine level was only 1.63 mg/dL. We suspected of type II hepatorenal syndrome overlapped with hepatic encephalopathy.\nAlthough the combination therapy of fluid replacement and diuretics started, his creatinine level was elevated to 4.02 mg/dL during 10 days. The urine output for 24 hours decreased to 500 mL. The patient was diagnosed with HRS on the basis of the criteria outlined by the International Ascites Club.\nOn the admission day 11, intravenous terlipressin along with albumin (20%, 100 mL) was administered for the management (1 mg q 4 hour) of HRS. He complained of severe cramping abdominal pain whenever a single injection of bolus terlipressin was administered. This complication was common, predictable, and thoroughly controlled by means of low-dose analgesics. Total urine output per 24 hours increased to 3,650 mL in 10 days when terlipressin was injected. On the admission day 22, the patient's clinical condition improved, and mentality changed to a clear state. The chemistry panel of the patient decreased: BUN to 30.63 mg/dL and creatinine to 1.29 mg/dL. However, on the day 11 after the terlipressin administration, the patient complained of severe tearing pain of both lower legs, and discoloration, necrosis, and gangrene were found in the 1st and 2nd toes of the right foot and the 1st, 2nd and 3rd toes of the left foot on physical examination. The terlipressin injection was discontinued immediately. These changes progressed to ischemia throughout the feet, accompanied by poor peripheral pulse and delayed wound healing as shown in .\nThe wounds in both feet were dressed with hydrocolloid solution. The patient still complained of continuous pain in both legs. A 3-phase bone scan showed an increased tracer uptake in the right 1st and 2nd toes, and the left toes and tarsal bone. The diagnosis assumed by the bone scan was osteomyelitis with osteonecrosis of the left foot, and osteomyelitis of the right foot (). However, 3-dimension angiographic CT of lower extremities was not taken due to the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy.\nFor prevention of the enlargement of gangrene or necrosis and healing tissue damage, intravenous alprostadil (prostaglandin E1, 10 \u00b5g/day) was administered continuously. The patient's serum creatinine stabilized during alprostadil administration. On the 6th day after the administration of alprostadil, an oral sildenafil (cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, 50 mg q 12 hour) was added to promote the peripheral circulation. Two days later, his urine output decreased to 445 mL/24h. Serum creatinine level was elevated to 2.8 mg/dL again. The combination therapy of alprostadil and sildenafil was withdrawn promptly. Intravenous furosemide was reintroduced. One week later, the creatinine level decreased again to 1.3 mg/dL, and urine output was held at 2,000 mL/24h. The mental status and clinical condition improved well ().\nThough the lesions of the right 1st and 2nd toes were recovered completely by vigorous dressing and medication, the left three toes with severe necrosis and osteomyelitis needed to be amputated finally (). On the admission day 44, a 3-dimension angiographic CT of the lower extremities was taken. It showed moderate stenosis with multifocal calcified plaques at both femoral and popliteal arteries, and mild stenosis at both anterior tibial arteries.

The patient's symptoms aggravated at fetal gestational age of 10 weeks and her last pregnancy was aborted 2 years earlier at another hospital due to severe intestinal obstruction. She had suffered from unexplainable obstructive symptoms 5 years earlier and was diagnosed with CIP because of repetitive obstructive symptoms without any visible obstructive lesion observed on abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT), barium enema, or colonoscopy (). Anorectal manometry was performed at another hospital and the results were normal. She was most recently admitted to our hospital 5 months ago because of recurrent obstructive symptoms. Because the intravenous administration of neostigmine was not effective, colonoscopic decompression was performed at that time. The patient was discharged after her condition improved.\nAt the time of admission, physical examination revealed the presence of abdominal distension and diffuse tenderness. Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell count of 8,120/mm3, a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL, a platelet count of 281,000/mm3, a blood sugar level of 99 mg/dL, a blood urea nitrogen level of 12.2 mg/dL, a creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL, a sodium level of 139 mEq/L, a potassium level of 3.8 mEq/L, a chloride level of 104 mEq/L, a calcium level of 8.7 mg/dL, a phosphorous level of 3.6 mg/dL, and a magnesium level of 1.8 mg/dL. Neither radiologic study nor neostigmine administration could be performed because of the risk to the fetus. Colonoscopy was performed to provide decompression because the patient's pain and distension worsened after 5 days of conservative care. The colonoscope was passed just beyond the splenic flexure, at which point the lumen was found to be obstructed by a large fecal bezoar (). Attempts to break the fecal bezoar with an endoscopic snare (Olympus Disposable Electrosurgical Snare SD-210U-10; Olympus Medical Systems Corp., Tokyo, Japan) met with limited success. After suctioning the retained gas and contents of the proximal colon, a drainage catheter (ENBD-7-LIGUORY, 7 Fr, 250 cm; Cook Medical Inc., Winston-Salem, NC, USA) was placed through the working channel of the endoscope. The catheter was irrigated periodically with normal saline to prevent obstruction and ensure that the intestinal contents and gas were drained effectively. The patient's symptoms improved for a few days after decompression but recurred soon thereafter. Additional two attempts at endoscopic decompression were made and a new drainage catheter was inserted in each of the attempts until surgery could be performed.\nSubtotal colectomy with endileostomy was performed electively at a fetal gestational age of 21 weeks. Ileorectal anastomosis could not be performed due to the enlarged uterus and was postponed until after delivery. The excised colon measured 100 cm in length. The proximal portion from the cecum to the descending colon was dilated up to 16 cm in diameter and a focally narrowed transitional zone was observed around the sigmoid colon (). Full colonic sections were obtained for histopathological analysis, which revealed no apparent histopathological alteration in the muscularis propria or neural plexuses ().

At that time, laboratory tests ruled out the presence of gallstones, tumors, autoimmune diseases, or metabolic diseases. Her pancreatic exocrine and endocrine functions were completely normal after each episode. Fifteen years after the last episode of pancreatitis, she presented with alopecia, malar rash, and oral ulcers. She was initially diagnosed as having discoid lupus with the skin biopsy results. However, a week later, she developed severe neuropsychiatric manifestations of SLE, including focal motor seizures, with a Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score of 18 points. Rheumatologists prescribed methylprednisolone (three doses of 1 g daily by intravenous injection) with improvement of neurological symptoms. Her treatment at hospital discharge was: chloroquine (225 mg/day), levetiracetam (1.5 g twice a day), phenytoin (100 mg twice a day), lorazepam (1 mg/day), and a monthly bolus of CY. In addition, she was treated with weekly down-titrating doses of prednisone (initial dose of 1 mg/kg).\nSeven days after administration of the sixth dose of CY (cumulative dose of 6.25 g), she presented with asthenia, adynamia, polydipsia, nausea and vomiting, food intolerance, impaired visual acuity, and abdominal pain. The physical examination at our ED revealed tachycardia (125 beats per minute), tachypnea (27 breaths per minute), drowsiness, and dehydration. She presented with a normal body mass index and no stigmata associated with insulin resistance. Laboratory tests reported: serum glucose of 1240 mg/dl, sodium of 127 mEq/L, potassium of 5.56 mEq/L, chlorine of 86 mEq/L, arterial pH of 7.07, bicarbonate of 3.00 mmol/L, and ketonuria (80 mg/dl) with effective serum osmolarity of 322.8 mOsm/kg and total osmolarity of 334.1 mOsm/kg, with an anion gap of 43.56, urea 63 mg/dl, and creatinine of 1.58 mg/dl. Liver tests, amylase, and lipase were normal. After the diagnosis of a mixed hyperglycemic state with predominance of severe DKA, she was started on an aggressive intravenously administered fluid schedule with saline solution 0.9% and intravenous continuous insulin infusion (CII). During the first day she required a total of 165 units of insulin per day (2.75 U/kg per day). Table shows the clinical and biochemical evolution from first evaluation to resolution of DKA.\nDuring the first hours, traditional precipitant factors for DKA, such as infections or cardiac ischemia were ruled out.

Arterial blood gases revealed pH 7.19, PCO2 74.8 mm Hg, PO2 96 mm Hg. Chest radiograph showed no lung infiltrates. Sputum culture grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa, sensitive to cefipime and ciprofloxacin; however, it was thought to represent colonization. A diagnosis of COPD with acute exacerbation was made, for which he was given intravenous ceftriaxone 2 gm once daily, azithromycin 500 mg once daily, methylprednisolone 40 mg three times daily, and salbutamol and ipratropium bromide nebulizers. He made a gradual improvement, and after seven days he was shifted to oral prednisolone 40 mg once daily and oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid to complete two weeks of antibiotics. Prednisolone was given for a total of 13 days. Three weeks after admission he developed hemoptysis, chest tightness, and worsening cough. Sputum culture grew P aeruginosa for which he was given intravenous cefepime and ciprofloxacin. Sputum smear for acid fast bacilli (AFB) was negative. Because of worsening respiratory status and a chest radiograph showing an infiltrate involving the whole left lung and part of the right lung, bronchoscopy was performed on 27 January 2005. No endobronchial lesion was found. Antituberculous drugs in the form of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol were started. Bronchioalveolar lavage and bronchial wash were negative for AFB but bacterial culture grew P aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebisella pneumoniae. Cytologic examination of the bronchial wash and lavage revealed bronchial epithelial cells, few squamous cells in the background of numerous S stercoralis worms () and bacteria with inflammatory cells and blood. Transbronchial biopsy showed only intraalveolar hemorrhage with anthracotic pigments, but was negative for granuloma, viral inclusions, or malignancy. He was treated with oral ivermectin 12mg once daily. Two days later he complained of vomiting, lower abdominal pain, abdominal distention, and constipation. Physical examination revealed abdominal distention, lower abdominal tenderness, and sluggish bowel sounds. A plain radiograph of the abdomen revealed distended bowel loops but no air fluid levels.

Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a prominent soft tissue mass adjacent to the olecranon bursa and the posterior aspect of the medial epicondyle (). The patient underwent incision and debridement of the right olecranon bursa, and intraoperative cultures were obtained. After this procedure, infectious disease consultation was requested, and an antimicrobial regimen consisting of intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone and vancomycin was initiated. On postoperative day 1, cultures from the initial bursa aspiration in the outpatient setting revealed diphtheroids. Subsequent identification of Corynebacterium jeikeium was reported 24 hours later by the hospital-based Vitek 2\u00ae microbial identification system. On postoperative day 3, the patient was clinically improved, without significant pain, and was discharged from the hospital to receive oral doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for an additional 14 days. Due to concern for infection, as well as the patient's renal function, he received neither corticosteroids nor nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication during or following hospitalization. Both aspiration and intraoperative cultures were sent to a reference laboratory (Mayo Medical Laboratories, Rochester, MN, USA) for bacterial identification and in vitro susceptibility testing. T. bernardiae was isolated as the sole pathogen utilizing matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (score 2.1 with homology of the top ten results). In vitro susceptibility was determined by use of manual agar dilution which demonstrated activity of doxycycline as well as other antimicrobial agents (). Approximately two weeks following discharge, the patient was evaluated in the outpatient infectious disease clinic with marked improvement and no significant edema, erythema, pain, or drainage from his right elbow.", "Question": "What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L?", "LLM Answer": "126", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "139.598", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL.\nThe concentration of sodium is 126.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 126.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 126.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 126.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 126.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 126.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of glucose is 36.8 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 36.8 mmol. To convert 36.8 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 36.8 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.037 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.037 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 6.666 g glucose. To convert 6.666 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 6.666 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 6666.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 6666.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 666.6 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 36.8 mmol glucose/L converts to 666.6 mg glucose/dL. \nPlugging in these values into the formula gives us 126.0 mEq/L + 0.024 * (666.6 - 100) = 139.598 mEq/L.\nHence, the patient's corrected concentration of sodium is 139.598 mEq/L.", "Result": "Incorrect"}

The mother revealed the presence of recurrent rhinorrhoea from the first day of life.\nExamination revealed icterus. Abdomen examination showed hepatospenomegaly (liver on left side and spleen on right side) and umbilical hernia. Electrocardiogram (ECG) displayed inverted P waves in I, aVL and aVR, which were suggestive of situs inversus. Chest X-ray revealed evidence of bronchopneumonia and the cardiac shadow was on the right side. Ultrasonography abdomen also indicated situs inversus. Echocardiography was suggestive of situs inversus with dextrocardia with normal cardiac anatomy.

Due to the context of sepsis, hypovolemic status of the patient, and urinalysis findings, acute tubular necrosis was the suspected mechanism of acute kidney injury.\nAnalysis of serum electrolytes showed mild hyperphosphatemia (1.53 mmol/l, normal range 0.80\u20131.45 mmol/l), hyponatremia (131 mmol/l, normal range 136\u2013144 mmol/l), mild hypouricemia (246 \u00b5mol/l, normal range 286\u2013518 \u00b5mol/l), low serum chloride (94 mmol/l, normal range 98\u2013106 mmol/l), hypokalemia (2.8 mmol/l, normal range 3.6\u20134.6 mmol/l), and an anion gap of 10 mmol/l. The transtubular potassium gradient was elevated (16.4). Albumin level was 29 g/l (normal range 35\u201348 g/l), and creatinine kinase level was 312 U/l on admission, rising to 404 U/l the next day and normalizing on hospital day 4. Blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.49 (normal range 7.35\u20137.45) with elevated bicarbonates (29.3 mmol/l, normal range 22\u201326 mmol/l) and normal pCO2 (5.25 kPa, normal range 4.7\u20136.4 kPa). Urine pH was 6 (normal range 5\u20136.5). Presence of glycosuria (7 mmol/l, normal range 0.1\u20130.9 mmol/l), with concomitant euglycemia (6.6 mmol/l, normal range 4.1\u201311 mmol/l) and a hemoglobin A1c of 5.1% was highly suspicious of proximal tubular dysfunction.\nUpon admission, Streptococcus A rapid test was negative, chest radiograph was normal, and an abdominal ultrasound showed hepatomegaly, a heterogeneous parenchyma with hyperechogenicity around periportal spaces and lymph nodes, liver parenchymal arterialization, and a layer of perihepatic fluid, all consistent with hepatitis. The bile ducts were not dilated. Kidneys were of normal size and morphology, without any urinary tract dilatation. On the second day after admission, the patient developed drowsiness and confusion with high fever (exceeding 40 \u00b0C). Normal cerebral magnetic resonance imaging and lumbar puncture excluded central nervous system infection. Clinical features were suggestive of bacterial sepsis [sequential organ failure assessment [SOFA] score of 10], justifying empiric broad spectrum antibiotic therapy with intravenous ceftriaxone and oral clarithromycin.\nDetailed history revealed that the patient swam in a river in the Geneva lake area 1 week before hospital admission, raising the diagnostic suspicion of leptospirosis in this clinical setting. Serum polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Leptospira interrogans was positive, and specific serologies revealed elevated IgM levels (> 100 U/ml, normal range < 15 U/ml). Although IgG levels were below the positive threshold, the values increased from < 2 U/ml initially to 6 U/ml 1 week later (normal range < 10 U/ml). Unfortunately, no ulterior dosage was performed. Antibiotic therapy was changed to intravenous amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate and doxycycline for 7 days with clinical improvement. Serology for hantavirus was performed, revealing an indeterminate result due to nonspecific reactions. Considering the positive results for Leptospira interrogans, additional tests for hantavirus were not performed.\nAlong with clinical improvement, kidney function recovered with creatinine normalizing to 87 \u03bcmol/l on the sixth hospital day, and all electrolyte abnormalities resolved. Liver tests also normalized as confirmed by a routine blood sample 1 year after discharge. In addition, glycosuria significantly decreased from 7 to 0.5 mmol/l on the 12th day of hospital stay.", "Question": "What is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg?", "LLM Answer": "278", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "280.006", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing serum osmolality is 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18), where Na is the concentration of sodium in mmol/L, the concentration of BUN is in mg/dL, and the concentration of glucose is in mg/dL.\nThe concentration of sodium is 131.0 mmol/L. \nThe concentration of bun is 11.4 mmol/L.

The patient received his second Moderna COVID-19 vaccine two days prior to admission. The next day he developed generalized body aches, nausea, and an episode of vomiting. He denied any fevers or chills. Though he normally ambulates independently, he was unable to stand or get out of bed due to weakness and generalized pain when he woke up the morning of admission. His admission medications included alogliptin, empagliflozin, insulin aspart, insulin glargine, losartan, metformin, pioglitazone, and tamsulosin. He reports no recent changes in medications or intake of over-the-counter medications. Past medical history was significant for COVID-19 infection three months prior, which required hospitalization for 13 days and treatment with convalescent plasma, remdesivir, and dexamethasone, according to institutional standard treatment protocols at the time.\nOn exam, vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg, heart rate of 87/minute, temperature of 98.4\u00b0 F, and respiratory rate of 16/minute. He was in no acute distress. His strength was normal and symmetric bilaterally, cranial nerves II-XII were grossly intact, and sensory was intact to light touch bilaterally. An electrocardiogram (EKG) was negative for ischemia. Troponins, a respiratory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel including influenza, and COVID-19 PCR were negative.

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated by EMS upon arrival for pulseless electrical activity, and after eight minutes the patient achieved return of spontaneous circulation. She was subsequently intubated without the need for induction medications and transported to the emergency department (ED). Upon arrival to the ED, an initial physical exam revealed an intubated, unresponsive child with markedly diminished lung sounds bilaterally without wheezing, and an oxygen saturation of 60% on 100% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). Additionally, respiratory therapy reported extreme difficulty with ventilation. Initial bedside chest radiographs (CXR) () were obtained and showed evidence suggestive of bilateral pneumothoraces, which in conjunction with the patient\u2019s clinical picture prompted bilateral chest tube placement. Both returned large volumes of serous fluid, although no blood or air.\nContinuation of the primary survey revealed tachycardia at 132 beats per minute with strong and regular peripheral pulses in all extremities. There was no jugular venous distention. The abdomen was soft without masses. A limited neurologic exam revealed bilateral sluggish pupils, with the right pupil at 6 millimeters (mm) and the left pupil at 3 mm. There were no obvious signs of trauma, and no dermatologic findings.\nAfter initial stabilization, collateral history was obtained from the mother who stated the patient had been feeling tired with intermittent fevers over the prior few days, which led to a diagnosis of mild viral pneumonia by her outpatient pediatrician. Per her electronic health record, this was based on the patient\u2019s age, gradual onset of symptoms with non-toxic appearance, and non-focal pulmonary findings on auscultation. Imaging and medications were therefore deferred, but return precautions were given should the patient\u2019s clinical presentation worsen. With regard to her asthma, the patient had only occasionally used an inhaler for night-time coughing but otherwise had never been admitted, intubated, or prescribed oral steroids.

Laboratory results showing hyperglycemia (glucose, 500 mg/dL) and ketonuria strongly indicated DKA. The patient was transferred to our emergency unit because of worsening mental status despite initiation of therapy with intravenous fluid and shortacting insulin. The patient's medical history was unremarkable (her mother had type 2 diabetes mellitus). On admission, the patient was lethargic, severely dehydrated, and drowsy (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS, eye-verbal-motor]=14 [--]). Vital signs indicated tachycardia (124 beats/min), tachypnea (40 breaths/min), and hypothermia (35\u2103). Blood pressure was in the normal range (106/56 mmHg), body weight had decreased by 1.7 kg in the previous month to 48 kg (25th\u201350th percentile), and body mass index was 20 kg/m2 (50th\u201375th percentile). Chest and abdominal x-rays showed no specific abnormalities. Initial venous blood gas analysis indicated metabolic acidosis (pH, 6.92; PCO2, 27 mmHg; PO2, 57 mmHg; HCO3, 5.6 mmol/L). Serum chemistry and electrolyte tests revealed 569 mg/dL glucose, 133 mmol/L corrected sodium, 3.2 mmol/L potassium, 8.5 mg/dL corrected calcium, 2.1 mg/dL phosphate, 25.9 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 0.57 mg/dL creatinine, and 0.6 mmol/L lactate. Urinalysis indicated the presence of ketones and glucose. Endocrinologic assessments showed 0.26 ng/mL C-peptide (normal range, 0.6\u20132.3 ng/mL) and 15.7% glycosylated hemoglobin. Antiglutamic acid decarboxylase was positive (1.72 U/mL; range, 0\u20131 U/mL), whereas anti-islet cell and anti-insulin antibodies were negative. These findings indicated a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and severe DKA. The main metabolic data during hospitalization are shown in . Fluid (0.45% saline) and continuous intravenous insulin infusion therapy were initiated at a rate of 0.05 unit/kg/hr immediately according to DKA treatment protocol []. Hourly neurological evaluations were performed for signs of cerebral edema. Although the patient remained drowsy, signs of cerebral edema were not evident. The patient suffered a <1 min generalized tonic seizure at 4 hours postadmission that was followed by bradycardia and cardiopulmonary arrest. External cardiac massage was initiated, followed by one epinephrine injection. Spontaneous circulation resumed after 6 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Laboratory data after return of spontaneous circulation showed metabolic acidosis and hypophosphatemia (pH, 7.05; PCO2, 23.6 mmHg; PO2, 181 mmHg; HCO3, 6.7 mmol/L; glucose, 517 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 136 mmol/L; potassium, 3.2 mmol/L; corrected calcium, 8.8 mg/dL; phosphate, 1.2 mg/dL). The patient received K2HPO4 and KCl to achieve 1.9 mEq/kg/day of phosphorus after the cardiac arrest. A brain computed tomographic (CT) scan showed no brain edema or intracranial pathology. Dexamethasone and mannitol were prescribed for prevention of brain edema and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Although the patient remained drowsy (GCS=14 [--]), vital signs were stable. At 16 hours after initiation of DKA treatment, the patient became stuporous (GCS=9 [--]) with shallow, weak, and slow respiration that necessitated endotracheal intubation. Blood tests at this time revealed respiratory acidosis and severe hypophosphatemia (pH, 6.80; PCO2, 92.9 mmHg; PO2, 160.3 mmHg; HCO3, 14.6 mmol/L; glucose, 375 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 142 mmol/L; potassium, 2.8 mmol/L; phosphate, 0.4 mg/dL; lactate, 0.6 mmol/L). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 3.8 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. A repeat brain CT imaging study showed no specific findings. The patient's electrolyte and pH values began normalizing within 2 days but mechanical ventilation was still required because hypophosphatemia was not alleviated (phosphate, 1.4 mg/dL). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 5.7 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate.

On physical examination, multiple vesicles on the soft palate and maculopapular rashes were observed on both the hands and feet. She had a clear breathing sound, regular heartbeat without murmur, and soft abdomen with a normoactive bowel sound without an abdominal mass or abdominal tenderness. In initial laboratory studies, the serum glucose was decreased (41 mg/dL), erythrocyte sedimentation rate was slightly increased (17 mm/hr; reference range, 0\u201310 mm/hr), and C-reactive protein was slightly elevated (12.9 mg/L; reference range, 0.0\u20135.0 mg/L), and other laboratory studies were within the normal ranges. The white blood cell count was 7.8\u00d7103/\u00b5L, hemoglobin was 12.6 g/dL, platelet count was 252\u00d7103/\u00b5L, blood urea nitrogen was 15.0 mg/dL, creatinine was 0.42 mg/dL, cholesterol was 187 mg/dL, albumin was 4.3 g/dL, total bilirubin was 0.39 mg/dL, direct bilirubin was 0.11 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase was 34 IU/L, alanine aminotransaminase was 10 IU/L, sodium was 135 mmol/L, potassium was 4.4 mmol/L. Amylase and lipase tests were not performed at the time of admission. Urine ketone body was 3 positive in urinalysis. A chest X-ray showed no active lung lesions, cardiopulmonary angle blunting, or cardiomegaly. Abdomen X-rays showed a nonspecific bowel gas pattern without ileus or pancreatic calcification.\nWe treated the child conservatively with intravenous fluid. On the first hospital day (HD), her fever subsided. On the third HD, she complained of ear pain caused by acute otitis media and intravenous amoxicillin/clavulanate was administered at a dose of 90 mg/kg/day. On the fourth HD, she experienced severe epigastric pain and vomiting. Her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 107/80 mmHg; heart rate, 109 beats/min.; respiration rate, 24 breaths/min; and body temperature, 37.2\u2103. On physical examination, she complained of epigastric tenderness. The serum levels of amylase and lipase were remarkably elevated (amylase, 1,902 IU/L; reference range, 28\u2013100 IU/L; lipase, >1,500 IU/L; reference range, 13\u201360 IU/L). Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed mild diffuse swelling of the pancreas from head to tail with a small amount of ascites (), which suggested acute pancreatitis.\nConsidering the patient's history of HFMD, we thought that enterovirus, which is a common cause of HFMD, could be a pathogen. We asked the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for enterovirus typing of her stool sample. In the first step, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on the specimens targeting the 5' noncoding region capable of detecting all 68 serotypes, and the result was enterovirus-positive. In the second step, 2-step RT-PCR was performed targeting viral protein 1, which has a different structural enterovirus protein for each subtype, and CA16 was detected in the sample.\nAfter acute pancreatitis was diagnosed, the patient was fasted and given sufficient intravenous fluid. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen were given for pain control. Serum amylase and lipase were serially followed (). The fever, epigastric pain, and vomiting were recovered on the sixth HD. She was discharged on the 11th HD without pancreatitis-related complications. On the day of discharge, the serum levels of amylase and lipase were remarkably reduced (amylase, 289 IU/L; lipase, 893 IU/L).\nShe was followed up after discharge without any symptoms, and pancreatitis has not recurred yet.

There were no signs of systemic illness. He had multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus controlled with diet and exercise, peripheral neuropathy, chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic bronchitis, and congestive heart failure. He reported incurring a small skin tear secondary to a fall 2 months prior. However, the wound had acutely worsened after being discharged from an outside hospital 4 days prior. The primary reason for admission had been confusion and generalized weakness attributed to pneumonia and worsening CKD. However, he also received intravenous vancomycin and cefepime due to concern for cellulitis. At admission, tibia/fibula radiographs showed soft tissue irregularity consistent with superficial ulceration and no features of osteomyelitis. Intravenous doxycycline was initiated for empiric coverage. Surgical debridement on the 2nd day of admission (DOA), revealed frank purulence beneath the eschar with necrotic tissue throughout the entire anterior compartment down to tibial periosteum (). At this time, preliminary culture results revealed light growth of fungus, yeast, and coagulase negative staphylococcus. Intravenous fluconazole was added to the patient's medication regimen until further speciation results became available. On DOA 6, final culture results identified the fungus as Rhizopus. On DOA 7, preliminary pathology found marked necrosis and invasive fungal infection with hyphae; thus, the antifungal was changed to micafungin. On DOA 8, final pathology revealed features suggestive of mucormycosis including numerous irregularly shaped hyphae, scattered necrotic-appearing vessels, diffuse Periodic acid-Schiff staining, and poor Grocott-Gomori's methenamine silver staining. However, micafungin was maintained in effort to spare the patient's remaining renal function as there was no fungal growth on repeat cultures. After consultation with dermatology and nephrology, it was ultimately decided that the benefits outweighed the risks. Thus, the antifungal regimen was changed to liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB) on DOA 10. Despite continued aggressive debridement, LAmB, and the addition of isavuconazole, repeat pathology on DOA 21 and 27 both showed invasive mucormycosis throughout the soft tissue. Due to continued positive margins after serial debridement, worsening appearance, and after consultation with the mycology division at the National Institutes of Health, a knee disarticulation was performed on DOA 39. Pathology was negative for fungal elements indicating clean margins. There was no evidence of osteomyelitis on the patella. After stabilization of medical complications, he was discharged to acute rehabilitation 12 weeks after admission with 4 weeks of oral posaconazole remaining to complete a 10-week course.

Patient has no history of cancer, neurological deficits, immunodeficiencies, or COPD. He was diagnosed with marfan syndrome when he was 19 years old. After his CABG, aspirin, atorvastatin, and metformin were restarted, with the addition of metoprolol tartrate 25mg twice daily. More frequent episodes of presyncope occurred. An electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with normal PR, QRS and QTc intervals. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a normal left ventricular systolic function and 24-hour ambulatory Holter monitoring recorded multiple sinus pauses occurring from 11:22 p.m. until 11:46 a.m. with a maximum pause of 22 seconds occurring at 11:45:33 a.m. (see Figure ). During this observation, there were no episodes of presyncope. He was admitted to our hospital for further workup.

There was no history of any other drug intake. Serum electrolytes were within normal limits. As there was association with no other offending agent other than high dosage of amiodarone, we kept the possibility of amiodarone induced PVT. The patient was treated with intravenous magnesium (2 g) along with intravenous lidocaine (1 mg/kg IV bolus) with out any effect. Intravenous Atropine 1.2 mg was also given to accelerate the sinus rate but failed to suppress the arrhythmia. Two more boluses of lidocaine at five minute intervals along with infusion at a rate of 1 mg/min were administered but the patient continued to have PVT. As the arrhythmia failed to respond to intravenous magnesium, atropine and lidocaine, we thought to try phenytoin to suppress the arrhythmia (a class IB antiarrhythmic drug that suppresses early after depolarization (EAD)) responsible for initiation of PVT secondary to amiodarone overdose).[] Phenytoin was administered in a dosage of 100 mg slowly every 5 minutes. After administration of 300 mg of phenytoin, significant reduction in episodes of PVT was noted and sustained sinus rhythm with corrected QTc of 490 milliseconds was restored within 30 minutes []. The patient was administered intravenous phenytoin 300 mg/day for 2 more days followed by oral phenytoin 300 mg/day. He was discharged after 1 week on oral phenytoin. Predischarge holter monitoring showed normal sinus rhythm with infrequent monomorphic VPCs and no evidence of nonsustained or sustained VT.

The patient presented high fever, severe headache, and purulent nasal secretions over the last three days but his vital parameters were normal. Apart from his statement that he was a tobacco smoker, no previous medical conditions were reported.\nInitially, one week prior to hospitalization, he was diagnosed with inflammation of the paranasal sinusitis by a private otorhinolaryngologist who had prescribed a combined antibacterial medical treatment of amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium and clindamycin. However, five days later, he was referred to the emergency department (ED) of the rural hospital with epileptic seizure. Regarding his medical history, the patient had suffered from sinusitis five years ago but no history of epilepsy was mentioned, not even in his family history.\nThe CT scan that was performed revealed findings only in the right maxillary, ethmoid, and frontal sinuses but not in the parenchymal brain (Figures , ). Concerning the laboratory results, it was found a leukocytosis of over 20,000 per cubic millimeter of blood, elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and mild electrolyte disturbances. Because of high suspicion for meningitis or encephalitis, the patient was transported by ambulance to our university hospital for further investigation and treatment.\nFirstly in the neurology department, an intravenous combination of ceftriaxone, clindamycin, and acyclovir was given along with antiepileptics. However, for the following three days, there was no response to the antibiotics. On the contrary, the patient displayed dyspnoea and bradycardia but echocardiography did not demonstrate any pathology. For the dyspnoea, a CT scan of the chest was executed, which revealed pleural effusion and therefore it was decided to modify the antibiotic medication with vancomycin and meropenem.\nAfter 48 hours of treatment, the patient presented disorientation and abnormal behavior. The MRI of the brain that was performed, indicated the presence of a cerebral abscess in the right frontal lobe surrounded by oedema, which caused a slight displacement of the midline (Figure ). In a new CT scan, shadows in the right frontal sinus accompanied by frontal bone thinning in the lower-posterior wall were observed.\nA new evaluation was made by the otorhinolaryngologists who decided to proceed operatively. Endoscopically and under general anaesthesia, nasal polyps were detected in the nasal cavity, which were removed with the use of a flexible rhino endoscope. Then anterior ethmoidectomy and middle maxillary antrostomy were done along with drainage of pus from right sinuses. Ten days later, the fever was lower but still high and the leukocytosis was remaining. The patient started having disorientation while his headache was getting worse over days.\nDue to the unimproved clinical condition, neurosurgeons considered to proceed more drastically. Specifically, under general anaesthesia, a pterional craniotomy was performed and an open approach of the frontal and right temporal lobe was achieved (Figure ). Thereafter, the brain abscess was found in the right frontal lobe and anterior part of the right temporal lobe. The purulent material and the surrounding abscess capsule were completely removed, with intend to eradicate the infectious sources and to decompress the brain parenchyma by lessening intracranial pressure. In addition, samples were taken from the abscess and sent for microbiological study for antibiotic sensitivity. Pus culture was consistent with alpha-hemolytic streptococcus that was sensitive to the antibiotics.\nSubsequently, the patient was referred to the intensive care unit for constant care and close supervision for five days continuing intravenous antibiotics. The fever subsided within 72 hours. Neurological symptoms started resolving after 15 days and the patient was discharged nearly one month after the last operation presenting mild irritability, which was decreased gradually over the next two months.

She did not complain of vaginal discharge or menstrual abnormalities.\nShe is a nonsmoker and denied any personal or family history of venous thromboembolism. Her gynecological history was remarkable for five pregnancies. She had normal vaginal deliveries except for the last one, which required an emergency Cesarean section at 36 weeks and 5 days of gestation due to placenta previa type III. One month after delivery, the patient was started on desogestrel (0.075 mg oral daily) for contraception, which she continued for 2 years. Her menstrual period was irregular, and the last withdrawal bleeding was 2 weeks prior to clinic visit.\nDuring the initial clinic visit, her vital signs were within normal limits (temperature, 36.7\u00b0C; heart rate, 78 bpm; blood pressure, 100/66 mmHg).

This was because she appeared to be extremely dependent on her mother. She did not have any history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hepatitis previously. However, she had taken psychiatric medications for 6 months approximately 5 years ago. In addition, she also intermittently took medications for amenorrhea and osteoporosis.\nOn admission, her vital signs were: blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, pulse rate of 60 beats/min, respiration rate of 20 breaths/min, and body temperature of 36.5\u2103. She was alert, but looked chronically ill and cachexic. Her body weight was 30 kg and body mass index was 11.71 kg/m2.

She was scheduled to be admitted to the orthopedic department for pain control of lumbar spinal canal stenosis. However, she vomited once in the morning a week before presentation and was unable to bathe without assistance two days prior to admission. Blood tests revealed severe renal impairment. The patient was referred to the department of internal medicine for consultation on the day of admission. This patient\u2019s medical history included medial osteoarthritis of the left knee, lumbar spinal canal stenosis, and an L2 vertebral fracture two years before admission. There were no malignant findings. She was followed by her general practitioner for blood tests every six months. Her creatinine was 0.64 mg/dL eight months prior to the hospital visit and 1.14 mg/dL one month prior to the hospital admission with no further investigation. Her vital statistics were as follows: height 142 cm, weight 41.8 kg; blood pressure 145/76 mmHg, pulse rate 74 beats/min, body temperature 36.4\u00b0C, respiratory rate 16 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) 98%. Blood tests revealed severe renal dysfunction with the following levels: blood urea nitrogen 139.9 mg/dL, creatinine 16.81 mg/dL, Na 134 mEq/l, K 7.5 mEq/l, Cl 100 mEq/l, Ca 8.1 mg/dL, P 11.4 mg/dL, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 101 mm/hour. Urinalysis showed white blood cells (2+), protein (2+), occult blood (1+), and granular and waxy casts in the urine sediments on the fourth day of admission (Tables -). Blood gas tests revealed the following: pH 7.146, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) 21.6 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3) 7.2 mmol/L, cK+ 7.5 mmol/L, cLac 0.4 mmol/L, and AnGap 16.9 mmol/L. The lab tests indicated metabolic acidosis with an enlarged anion gap.\nEmergency hemodialysis with a right internal jugular vein catheter was initiated on the second day of admission. Considering further rapid progression, steroids were urgently administered on the third day of admission due to suspicion of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated glomerulonephropathy. This was performed prior to a bone marrow biopsy and immunofixation electrophoresis. Considering renal atrophy and renal damage due to malignancy, an abdominal CT, head MRI, and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were performed. However, there was no renal atrophy, and no obvious malignant findings were observed (Figure ). Additional tests for antinuclear antibody, anti-streptolysin 0 antibody, anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody, and anticardiolipin antibody were all normal. The serum immunoelectrophoresis that we had submitted on the second day of admission came back on the eighth day, and the IgG, IgA, and IgM had decreased. On the twentieth day of admission, a renal biopsy of the right kidney was performed. Crystals in the tubules and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-negative urinary casts suggested acute kidney injury associated with cast nephropathy (Figures -). Additional investigations were performed to determine the cause of the cast nephropathy. On the 33rd day of admission, Bence-Jones protein-\u03bb M protein was detected in the urine. And IgD-\u03bb M protein and Bence-Jones protein-\u03bb protein were detected on the 36th day (Figure ). Additional blood data showed a \u03bb type free light chain of 8440 mg/L (\u03ba/\u03bb ratio of <0.001). This indicated light chain MM or monoclonal gammaglobulinemia (MGRS). Bone marrow examination showed scattered plasma cell nests of 23%, which was consistent with MM (Figure ). Finally, the patient was diagnosed with IgD-\u03bb type MM. There were indications for treatment. However, based on a discussion with a hematologist, it was concluded that active treatment for myeloma would not improve the patient\u2019s condition. This patient was bedridden and her condition was poor. The side effects of the treatment could have impinged on her appetite and condition. When we discussed this with the patient, she refused to undergo chemotherapy or further active treatment. As a result of this discussion, we decided to treat her with palliative measures. For the anemia, we employed a blood transfusion and a darbepoetin alfa injection. Maintenance dialysis was initiated for the chronic renal failure.

The patient indicated her understanding and gave verbal consent for full resuscitative measures in the perioperative period. American Society for Anesthesiologist (ASA) monitors were placed and a right radial arterial line was inserted in sterile fashion in place of the noninvasive blood pressure cuff to avoid possible bony trauma. An arterial blood gas was immediately obtained.\nFiberoptic intubation was attempted to avoid possible complications from direct laryngoscopy, anticipated difficult airway, and use of succinylcholine. No sedation was given secondary to possible risk of aspiration, hemodynamic instability, and desaturation in the setting of a difficult airway. The airway was topicalized with aerosolized 4% lidocaine and a negative gag reflex was achieved. The initial fiberoptic intubation was attempted unsuccessfully via an Ovassapian airway. There was limited mouth opening, and the mouth was small as well. These features made placement of the Ovassapian airway difficult. The patient had a persistent gag reflex despite additional topicalization through an epidural catheter threaded in the bronchoscope port. A second fiberoptic attempt was made through a slit 22 F nasopharyngeal trumpet placed in the left nostril. The nares were tight and edematous. These features made it difficult to pass the bronchoscope down the correct passage to the nasopharyngeal space. Despite the distorted anatomy, the nasal fiberoptic approach proved successful.

Further exploration of the abdominal contents confirmed a ruptured uterus with an extra-uterine fetal demise.\nThe option of hysterectomy was discussed by the obstetricians and gynecologic-oncologists due to the increased risk of morbidity and mortality for this patient. The surgeons were primarily concerned about possible uterine rupture and postpartum hemorrhage in subsequent pregnancies. Secondary concerns regarding this patient included poor prenatal care and failure to obtain anesthesiology consultation prior to admission for delivery. The anesthetic consultation was felt necessary for team-based clinical management planning due to the high-risk nature of this patient's condition. In response to the considerations for hysterectomy while in the operating room, the anesthesiologist advocated for the patient's wishes, reemphasizing her desire to maintain fertility, if possible. The uterus was repaired and conserved. The patient was transported to SICU and was successfully extubated on postoperative day #1 without complications.", "Question": "What is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters? You may take the ideal sodium concentration to be 140 mEq/L.", "LLM Answer": "2.21", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "-0.132", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the free water deficit is (total body water percentage) * (weight) * (sodium/140 - 1), where the total body water percentage is a percentage expressed as a decimal, weight is in kg, and the sodium concentration is in mmol/L.\nThe patient's total body weight percentage is based on the patient's age and gender.\nThe patient is 25 years old. The patient's is a Female.\nThe patient's age is between 18 and 64 and so the patient is an adult. For adult female's the total body water percentage value is 0.50.\nThe patient's weight is 37.0 kg. The concentration of sodium is 139.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 139.0 mEq. To convert from 139.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 139.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 139.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 139.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 139.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 139.0 mmol sodium/L. Plugging in these values into the equation, we get 0.5 * 37.0 * (139.0/140 - 1) = -0.132 L. The patient's free body water deficit is -0.132 L.", "Result": "Incorrect"}

Prior to admission, she had suffered from polyuria, polydipsia, and nycturia for about 2 weeks, and presented with fatigue, drowsiness and a lack of appetite for the last two days. Her history did not include any chronic diseases, and she had normal growth and development.\nOn admission, she was in a serious state, suffering from vomiting and dehydration, and displaying Kussmaul breathing, a respiratory rate of 45 breaths/min and tachycardia. The blood test revealed a blood glucose level of 26.8 mmol/L (482 mg/dl), pH 6.902, base excess (BE) of \u2212 29.3 mmol/L, HbA1c of 12.9%, sodium level of 142 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.11 mEq/L and ketone level of 6.1 mmol/L. The patient was treated according to the recommendations of the International Society of Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes and the Polish Diabetes Association [, ].\nInitially the patient received 500 ml of 0.9% NaCl IV infusion. Next, a continuous IV infusion of short acting insulin was commenced with 2,5 U/ h dose, taking into consideration that the patient weight was 40 kg. IV Insulin infusion was sustained for 51 h with dosages ranging from 1,5 U/h to 4 U/h. Overall the patient received 81,75 units of IV insulin during the first 24 h of treatment. Moreover, potassium was supplemented intravenously accordingly to changes in electrolytes results. Although she remained in a serious condition during the first 24 h of treatment, she stopped vomiting and showed gradual improvement in blood test results, with pH normalization and a decrease in the level of ketones. The glucose level was maintained between 8.3 and 13.9 mmol/L (150\u2013250 mg/dl) with intravenous insulin and glucose infusions. The neurological status was checked hourly, and was reported as stable. An ECG was performed within the first few hours of admission, which did not reveal any crucial abnormalities aside from tachycardia. The patient received 65 units of IV insulin during the second 24 h f treatment. During the whole continuous insulin infusion the patient fluid input was 7850 ml (4750 ml IV, 3100 ml orally) and diuresis was 3400 ml.\nThe patient\u2019s overall condition improved during the second day of treatment, despite the fact that she was still receiving intravenous insulin. That day irregular heartbeats were noticed on auscultation during the physical examination and on the ECG monitor. A second ECG showed premature ventricular complexes (PVCs; also known as trigeminy) with LBBB (left bundle branch block) morphology and a normal axis (Fig. ). Continuous ECG monitoring was subsequently implemented, and the patient underwent a cardiac consultation. The echocardiogram showed no abnormalities in the structures of the heart and great vessels. The consultant cardiologist confirmed the diagnosis of ventricular arrhythmia (PVCs). The blood results revealed hypokalemia (nadir at 2.9 mmol/L) and hypophosphatemia (nadir at 0.45 mmol/L).\nThe ECG performed after the first recognition of the patient\u2019s the irregular heart rhythm (Fig. ) showed: sinus rhythm at 100/min, normal cardiac axis, with premature ventricular complexes. Normal PQ interval (0,14 s), normal QRS duration (0,08 s), normal QT interval (0,31 s)and QTc 0,40 QTd 0,04 s. Normal T wave and repolarization. The biochemistry results at that moment were: Na 134 mmol/L Na 134 mmol/l [132\u2013145]; K 3,56 mmol/l [4,1-5,3]; Ca 2,70 mmol/l [2,1-2,6]; Mg 0,83 mmol/l [0,53-1,11]; Phosphate 0,45 mmol/l [1,1-2,0] (assessed for the first time); pH 7,34 [7,35-7,45]; BE-11,5 mmol/l [\u2212 2,0/+ 3,0]; HCO3 14,2 mmol/l [22,5-30,0]. CK level was not determined. The pattern visible in the ECG was not typical of hypokalemia, which is connected with initial T-wave decrease, followed by ST-segment depression, T-wave inversion, PR interval prolongation and increased P-wave amplitude, observed with further decreases in serum potassium levels. Severe hypokalemia may be associated with giant U-waves created by T- and U-wave fusion. Tachyarrhythmia and rarely atrioventricular block may evolve [\u2013]. In our case we did not observe such abnormalities typical to low potassium level in the ECG. Moreover, the ECG was not typical of hypercalcaemia, which causes prolonged PQ interval and shortening of QT interval [, ]. Taking above into consideration we propose possible association between hypophosphatemia and premature ventricular complexes reported in the ECG.\nPotassium was supplemented both orally and intravenously. Overall the patient received 123 mEq of potassium during the continuous insulin therapy. As far as phosphorus is concerned, the patient was fed with liquid dairy products that were rich in phosphate, as she was only able to swallow small amounts of non-solid foods due to odynophagia. She was also started on oral phosphate supplementation (phosphate mixture containing 17.8 g Na2HPO4 and 4.88 g NaH2PO4 in 100 ml of distilled water, containing 1.6 mmol of inorganic phosphate per 1 ml). As 1 mmol of inorganic phosphate weighs 31 mg, our patient was receiving 62 mg Pi/kg body weight every 24 h from the phosphate mixture. She continued to present an irregular heart rate, thus a 24-h ECG Holter monitor examination was performed. The results showed 38,000 monomorphic PVCs, 1615 occurrences of ventricular bigeminy, 1230 of ventricular trigeminy and 453 of ventricular quadrigeminy, which comprised 38% of all the heart electrical activity recorded.\nThe patient was started on intensive subcutaneous insulin regimen at the 3 day of treatment, after the biochemistry results improved. In the beginning she was receiving 15 units of ultra- long acting basal insulin and 27,5 units of rapid acting insulin for meals and correction doses.\nThe patient\u2019s serum phosphate level normalized over the few next days of treatment (Table ), and ventricular arrhythmia ceased almost completely. Subsequent ECG Holter examination showed 1760 PVCs, 13 episodes of ventricular bigeminy and 79 episodes of ventricular trigeminy. Additionally, we noticed hypocalcaemia after 3 days of phosphate supplementation. Taking into consideration the patient\u2019s severe vitamin D3 deficiency (25(OH)D3 level 9.83 ng/ml), we supplemented both calcium and vitamin D3.\nGradually the patient regained insulin sensivity and entered a partial remission phase. C- peptide level was 0,84 ng/ml.\nThe patient was discharged in an overall good condition receiving intensive functional insulin therapy. The regimen included 10 units of basal insulin administered once daily in the evening and rapid acting insulin with insulin: carbohydrate ratio set for each meal and also with recommended correction doses.\nA cardiac check-up at the outpatient clinic following discharge revealed no signs of cardiac arrhythmia. The patient is currently on an insulin pump therapy regimen, and her growth and development are within the normal range.", "Question": "What is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters?

Although she appeared drowsy and unwell, her systemic examination was unremarkable and no focal abnormalities were found on neurological examination of the central or peripheral nervous system. Initial biochemical analysis revealed sodium 127 mmol/l, potassium 3.2 mmol/l, urea 3.8 mmol/l, creatinine 77 and glucose 4.1 mmol/l. Inflammatory markers (white cell count and C-reactive protein) were normal. A computerised tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) of the brain demonstrated normal ventricles, no focal lesion or mass effect and normal sagittal sinus flow. Upon lumbar puncture, performed in the lateral decubitus position, an opening pressure of 40 mm of water was documented. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) microscopy revealed two white blood cells (WBCs) per mm3, <1 red blood cell (RBC) per mm3 and no organisms. CSF chemistry was unremarkable: protein 0.4 g/l and glucose 3.2 mmol/l. The patient had remained drowsy and she was managed in the Intensive Care Unit with a presumptive diagnosis of acute meningoencephalitis with a secondary syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH). No measurements of serum or urine osmolality were made. She was treated with antibiotics and acyclovir and was also supported with intravenous fluids and, within 24 hours, had improved such that she was transferred back to the ward.\nDuring subsequent review she admitted to several months of generalised fatigue, sometimes falling asleep at work, and of intermittent headaches. With subsequent neurology specialist input to review the grossly elevated intracranial pressure, accompanied by normal imaging and CSF analysis, the patient was commenced on acetazolamide 250 mg daily for presumed idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Visual acuity and visual field (Goldman perimetry) testing was unremarkable. On endocrine review, generalised hyperpigmentation with facial melasma were noted and, although she had no buccal pigmentation, she did have marked pigmentation of a recent scar over her left shoulder (Figure ). A short synacthen (250 mcg) test (SST) was performed and demonstrated adrenal insufficiency with basal cortisol at 231 nmol/l, 30 minute cortisol 265 nmol/l and 60 minute at 200 nmol/l. A repeat SST showed basal cortisol at 138 nmol/l and 30 minute cortisol at 159 nmol/l and confirmed adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal antibodies were negative. Her plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was raised at >278 pmol/l consistent with primary adrenal failure. She was commenced on glucocorticoid (hydrocortisone 10 mg bd) and mineralocorticoid (fludrocortisone 50 mcg) replacement therapy and discharged. On subsequent review two weeks later, she was feeling much better with CSF pressure reduced to 25 mm of water on repeat lumbar puncture.

He reported an episode of gum bleeding after cleaning his teeth. There was no history of traveling abroad in the last months and no recent contact with animals. Two weeks prior to the onset of his symptoms the patient sustained a minor knee injury resulting in a skin abrasion while bathing in the river Isar close to Munich, Germany.\nThe patient works as a computer scientist and has no relevant medical history. Weight and height upon admission were recorded to be 90 kg and 189 cm, respectively (BMI = 25.2 kg/m2). Alcohol, nicotine, or drug anamnesis was negative. No medication or allergies were reported.\nOn examination, the patient appeared tired, but he displayed no neurological abnormalities. Body temperature was 36.8 \u00b0C, pulse 90 bpm, blood pressure 114/75 mmHg, respiratory rate 16 bpm, and oxygen saturation 99% while breathing ambient air. The lungs and heart auscultation was unremarkable, the abdomen was soft and non-tender. The skin and scleral inspection revealed jaundice and a slight gum bleeding was observed during the examination of the oral cavity. Upon pressure, tenderness in the thighs and calves was reported.\nAbdominal ultrasound upon admission to the hospital revealed hepatosplenomegaly and no signs of intra- or extrahepatic cholestasis. White-cell count was 9.9 G/L (87% neutrophils and 3.5% lymphocytes), platelet count 39 G/L, and hemoglobin 13.3 g/dl. Serum sodium level was 123 mmol/l, potassium 3.15 mmol/l, and creatinine 2.8 mg/dl (248 \u03bcmol/l) with glomerular filtration rate of 31 ml/min/1.73m2.

An overview of laboratory test results with the corresponding reference ranges is shown in Table .\nOn day 1 upon admission an empiric intravenous antimicrobial regime with doxycycline (100 mg every 24 h) and ceftriaxone (2 g every 24 h) was initiated while a selection of tests in search for microbial and viral agents was pending. The patient received intravenous fluid and electrolyte replacement. Within 48 h upon admission, hypokalemia (2.32 mmol/l) and hyponatremia (113 mmol/l) worsened significantly without signs of acid-base dysregulation in blood gas analysis. Creatinine increased to 4.37 mg/dl (386 \u03bcmol/l), and a polyuria with up to 7.2 L urine output /24 h was documented. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) at the initial collaborating institution and \u2014 approximately 48 h later \u2014 transferred to the ICU at our university hospital. Starting from day 4 since the initial admission creatinine levels started to decrease, polyuria was in regress and potassium and sodium levels normalized. In addition, platelet count improved and C-reactive protein decreased. The patient remained afebrile. Despite the gradually improving general condition of the patient, serum bilirubin levels were constantly rising starting from day 1 since admission, reaching its maximum on day 4 (54 mg/dl total bilirubin, 39 mg/dl direct bilirubin). Aspartate and alanine aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltransferase remained normal or mildly elevated (Table ).\nUrine and blood cultures revealed no growth. Screening tests for hepatotropic viruses (hepatitis A, B, C, and E) as well as HIV, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus were negative.

Normal levels of serum copper (110 \u03bcg/dl, reference range: 70\u2013140 \u03bcg/dl) as well as serum ceruloplasmin (0.44 g/l, reference range: 0.2\u20130.6 g/l) allowed to dismiss Wilson\u2019s disease from diagnostic consideration.\nThe presumptive diagnosis of icteric leptospirosis was strengthened by detection of antileptospiral IgM antibodies with the use of ELISA in the acute phase serum specimen (38 U/ml, reference range: < 15 U/ml, SERION ELISA classic Leptospira IgG/IgM, Virion Serion, W\u00fcrzburg, Germany) and confirmed by an accredited PCR method using proprietary primers at the Institute for Medical Microbiology and Hygiene at the University of Regensburg, Germany. The therapy with doxycycline was discontinued (total duration of 3 days) and the regime with ceftriaxone carried on as a targeted monotherapy (total duration of 12 days).\nThe patient was discharged home after a total of 12 days of hospitalization (3 days at the ICU). The general condition upon discharge was reported as good; fatigue was declining and the remaining symptoms, with the exception of jaundice (total bilirubin 6.2 mg/dl), subsided.\nThroughout hospitalization and a 3-month follow-up period, indocyanine green plasma disappearance rates were recorded multiple times. For each measurement, 25 mg of the ICG dye were dissolved in 5 ml of distilled water, and a dose of 22.5 mg (0.25 mg/kg body weight) was injected intravenously. ICG-PDR was determined via non-invasive, transcutaneous pulse dye densitometry with the use of the LiMON device (Pulsion Medical Systems SE, Feldkirchen, Germany). Initial concentration at time \u201c0\u201d was set to be 100% and plasma disappearance rate was calculated as percentage change over time (%/min) [].

The measured ICG-PDR values, total bilirubin and alanine aminotransferase serum levels are displayed in Fig. .\nInitially severely reduced ICG-PDR (2%/min on day 5 upon initial admission) gradually improved within several days to reach almost normal level on day 10 upon initial admission to hospital (17.4%/min). Approximately 7 weeks after initial hospitalization, ICG-PDR was recorded to be within normal range (23.7%/min) and reached 33.4%/min on day 85. While ICG-PDR values rapidly normalized in parallel with clinical improvement, serum bilirubin levels were slowly decreasing (44.4 mg/dl on day 5 and 9.0 mg/dl on day 10 upon hospitalization), and it was only until 7 weeks upon admission that they reached normal levels (Fig. ). Mild elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase was at its peak of 124 U/l on day 12 upon hospitalization (Table ) and reached close to normal levels by week 7 upon admission (Fig. and Additional file ).

In physical examination, she had no remarkable symptom such as palpitation, general fatigue and insomnia and did not have a goiter. Her height and body weight were 158.0 cm and 63.6 kg. Her vital signs were: heart rate 112 beats/min, blood pressure 132/86 mmHg.

Thyroid-associated data were as follows: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), < 0.010 \u03bcIU/mL; free triiodothyronine (FT3), 19.05 pg/mL; free thyroxine (FT4) 4.88 ng/dL; TRAb, 10.6 IU/L (electro chemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA), SRL Inc., Tokyo); TPOAb, 216.9 IU/mL (ECLIA, SRL Inc., Tokyo); TgAb antibody, 428.9 IU/mL (ECLIA, SRL Inc., Tokyo). Ultrasound examination revealed that the thyroid gland was hypervascular although it was not enlarged (Fig. ). Based on such findings, we finally diagnosed her as Basedow\u2019s disease. Two weeks after starting MMI therapy, she had liver dysfunction (AST, 420 U/L; ALT, 368 U/L; ALP, 565 U/L; \u03b3-GTP, 178 U/L; LDH, 337 U/L), and we changed the treatment of MMI to 300 mg of propylthiouracil (PTU) although her thyroid hormone levels were decreased (TSH, < 0.010 \u03bcIU/mL; FT3, 7.2 4 pg/mL; F T4 1.97 ng/dL). After then, her liver function was improved, and we tapered PTU. About 2 years later, her thyroid hormone levels were within normal range with 50 mg of PTU every other day, and her TRAb became negative. After then, we stopped PTU therapy.\nAbout 1.5 years later, she had low grade fever and palpitation and visited our office again. Her body weight was 70.9 kg.

Based on such findings, we finally diagnosed her as the relapse of Basedow\u2019s disease. We started again 300 mg of PTU and tapered PTU dose. About 4 months later, her thyroid hormone levels became within normal range by taking 50 mg of PTU every other day. During the PTU therapy, her WBC levels were slightly lower and CRP levels were slightly higher, although she had no symptom in the whole body including in skin. We checked various autoimmune antibodies. Anti-double stranded DNA IgG antibody, anti-SS-A/Ro antibody and anti-SS-B/La antibody were all negative. However, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), myeloperoxidase-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA) and proteinase3-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (PR3-ANCA) were all positive (ANA, 37.8 (+); MPO-ANCA, 35.0 U/mL; PR3-ANCA, 36.9 U/mL).\nWe performed a total thyroidectomy. Table shows laboratory data before a total thyroidectomy in this subject taking 50 mg of PTU every other day. In general, the thyroid gland in subjects with Basedow\u2019s disease shows diffuse goiter due to chronic stimulation. However, her thyroid was flat and atrophic although diffuse hyperplasia of the thyroid gland was observed in histopathological macroscopic findings (Fig. ). Furthermore, hyperplasia of the thyroid gland was shown in part and hyperplastic thyroid follicles with papillary infoldings was observed in histopathological microscopic examination. Tall follicular cells with papillae usually lacked fibrovascular cores and peripheral scalloping was present (Fig. ). On the other hand, a part of the thyroid area showed a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, accompanied by follicles containing germinal centers. In addition, a destroyed pattern of lymphoid follicle was observed (Fig. ).\nOne year later, thyroid-associated autoimmune antibodies were all decreased (TRAb, 2.2 IU/L; TSAb, 130% (enzyme immunoassay, SRL Inc., Tokyo); TPOAb, 98. 3 IU/mL; TgAb, 151.0 IU/mL), and 2 years later thyroid-associated autoimmune antibodies were further improved (TRAb, 1.1 IU/L; TSAb, 90%; TPOAb, 24.0 IU/mL; TgAb, 12.8 IU/mL).

He had been in good health until 1 year earlier, when he noticed reduced livido. Four months before admission, he noticed frequent headaches, thirst, polydipsia, and polyuria. Because he was voiding urine every hour, he visited his family doctor. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a suprasellar mass, and he was thus referred to our hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Although polydipsia and polyuria had been gradually relieved by the time of admission, he became aware of increased fatigability.\nAt the time of admission, he was 176 cm tall and weighed 72 kg. His temperature was 37.6\u00b0C, pulse rate was 60/min, and blood pressure was 110/60 mmHg. No goiter or enlargement of lymph nodes was noted. Axillar and pubic hair were lost and there was palpable erythematous rush on his forehead (). The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nLaboratory results revealed the following results: blood urea nitrogen 9.6 mg/dL, creatinine 0.79 mg/dL, serum sodium 141 mEq/l, potassium 4.0 mEq/l, chloride 100 mEq/l, calcium 9.4 mg/dL, phosphate 3.7 mg/dL, fasting plasma glucose 80 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein 0.07 mg/dL. Endocrinologic data revealed a mild decrease in free T4 level (0.6 ng/dL) with normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level (0.9106 \u03bcU/mL) and decreased cortisol (4.7 \u03bcg/mL), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH; 6 pg/mL), luteinizing hormone (LH; 0.2 mIU/mL), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH; 1.3 mIU/mL), and testosterone (0.05 ng/mL) levels. Urinary cortisol was undetectable. Plasma osmolality was 288 mOsm/kgH2O, with a urinary osmolality of 239 mOsm/kgH2O, and arginine vasopressin (AVP) was undetectable (<0.15 pg/mL). Urinary output was from 1.5 to 2.2 L/day.\nHis clinical course and laboratory findings led us to suspect CDI with anterior pituitary dysfunction. We thus performed hormonal provocative tests. The patient was given an infusion of 5% saline at a rate of 0.05 mL/kg for 120 min. Although plasma AVP was undetectable before and after administration of hypertonic saline, urine osmolality (391 mOsm/kgH2O) increased above the plasma levels (296 mOsm/kgH2O) (). Hormonal provocative tests revealed that growth hormone (GH) response to GH-releasing hormone was normal, TSH response to TSH-releasing hormone was low and blunted, and FSH and LH response to LH-releasing hormone were low and blunted (). Although ACTH response to corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) was normal, cortisol response to CRH was low (maximum 13.0 \u03bcg/mL). Cortisol response to rapid ACTH stimulation test was low (maximum 15.9 \u03bcg/mL). Results of these hormonal tests were compatible with the diagnosis of CDI with partial GC deficiency.\nMRI revealed enhancing lesion centrally in the pituitary stalk, which spread continuously to the bottom of the third ventricle, and the high intensity of the posterior lobe was lost, compatible with the diagnosis of CDI (). Considering the patient's age, we first suspected of neurohypophysial germinoma. However, this was unlikely because cerebrospinal fluid was negative for malignant cells, and \u03b2-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) levels were normal. Next, we suspected sarcoidosis because chest X-ray revealed hilar enlargement. A biopsy from the skin of the forehead was performed, which revealed noncaseating granuloma composed of epithelioid cells (). Multinucleated giant cells were also present. Thus, the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made.\nWhile waiting for histologic confirmation of biopsy results, hydrocortisone replacement was begun with a dose of 20 mg daily. Soon after the replacement therapy was begun, moderate polyuria (3.5\u20134.0 liters daily) occurred (). After the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was confirmed, he was treated with 40 mg of prednisolone and his general condition improved. The hypertonic saline test was repeated while he was taking 40 mg of prednisolone. Plasma AVP was undetectable during the hypertonic saline test and urine osmolality was consistently below plasma levels, which was compatible with a diagnosis of CDI (). He was treated with 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (dDAVP).\nMRI following prednisolone therapy revealed a reduction in the size of the affected lesion.

His trachea was intubated at the scene, resuscitated with fluids, and transported to the University of Toledo Medical Center via air ambulance. The patient arrived with a blood pressure 186/96 mm Hg, heart rate 79 beats per minute, SpO2 90% on 1.0 FiO2, and his Glasgow coma scale was 3. His pupils were round and equally reactive to light at 3 mm bilaterally. A right 9 French femoral venous sheath and a left femoral arterial catheter were placed on arrival. Complete blood count revealed hemoglobin 14.4 g/dl, hematocrit 41.8%, platelets 218,000/mm3, white blood cell count 19,800/mm3, sodium 143 meq/L, potassium 3.5 meq/L, chloride 109 meq/L, Carbon dioxide 26 mm Hg, blood urea nitrogen 12 mg/dl, creatinine 1.2 mg/dl, glucose 139 mg/dl, calcium 8.2 mg/dl, prothrombin time 15.8 seconds, international normalized ratio 1.2, albumin 3.4 g/dl, total bilirubin 0.9 mg/dl, alkaline phosphatase 64 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase 57 IU/L, and alanine aminotransferase 43 IU/L. The initial arterial blood gas was pH 7.35, PaCO2 26 mm Hg, PaO2 60 mm Hg, HCO3 20 mmol/L, and base excess -5 mmol/L. The patient was given 10 mg vecuronium, and 25 grams of mannitol twice, intravenously. An electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm, and the chest roentgenogram revealed bilateral pulmonary edema, a small left apical pneumothorax, multiple fractured ribs on the right, and a severely congested right lung field. His SpO2 suddenly decreased to 78% with diminished breath sounds bilaterally, and bilateral chest tubes were placed with improvement of the SpO2 to 90%. Subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest confirmed a left pneumothorax, that the right chest was filled with fluid (there was a question of aspiration), and the presence of bilateral pulmonary edema; CT of head demonstrated a left occipital fracture, multiple intraparenchymal hemorrhages, and a left subdural hematoma that was determined not to need surgical evacuation because of its size and minimal midline shift (see CT scan figures , , ); and the CT scan of the abdomen was negative.\nHe was transferred to the intensive care unit where a right internal jugular 9 French sheath was placed for introduction of a pulmonary artery catheter, as was an intracranial pressure monitor (Camino). His initial ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure were 37 mm Hg and 57 mm Hg, respectively, on ventilator settings of assist control (AC) 30 (respiratory rate was 34), positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 (zero) mm Hg, tidal volume (Vt) 650 ml, FiO2 1.0, with an ABG of pH 7.28, PaCO2 44 mm Hg, PaO2 63 mm Hg, and HCO3 20 meq/L. The SpO2 was 92%, the central venous pressure was 12 mm Hg, and the lactate was 8.5 mmol/L (which improved with further resuscitation).\nOver the next seven days the patient's pulmonary status deteriorated and severe ARDS became manifest in the face of continued high ICP despite intensive intervention. On the morning of the seventh hospital day a critical point was reached. The ICP spiked to 70 mm Hg and remained over 50 mm Hg for greater than 2 minutes notwithstanding the use of mannitol, furosemide, hyperventilation, sedation, and paralysis, although these efforts maintained the CPP from 47\u201377 mm Hg. This high ICP occurred in the face of hypoxia and acidemia; ABG of pH 7.33, PaCO2 50 mm Hg, PaO2 54 mm Hg, base excess 0.1 mmol/L, and HCO3 26 meq/L while ventilated on AC 50 with Vt 500 ml, PEEP 7 cm H2O, and FiO2 1.0. The cardiac output was 11 liters/minute, and the cardiac index was 4.9 liters/minute/m2. The PEEP was raised to 17 cm H2O incrementally, while at the same time carefully evaluating ICP, peak inspiratory and plateau pressures, and oxygenation, in an effort to increase the PaO2 to an acceptable level (a goal of PaO2 100 mm Hg). In view of the fact that maximized ventilator settings, adequate sedation, paralysis, and inhalational therapies (albuterol and ipratropium) had neither improved the patient's intracranial pressures, nor his oxygenation, use of INO was implemented specifically to improve oxygenation and thereby decrease ICP. INO was instituted at 20 ppm. In a period of 35 minutes the ICP decreased to 15 mm Hg and PaO2 improved; ABG pH 7.35, PaCO2 49 mm Hg, PaO2 86 mm Hg, BE 0.7, and HCO3 27 meq/L on the same ventilator settings. Over 6 hours the PEEP was weaned to 11 cm H2O and the PaO2 remained at 90 mm Hg with the ICP ranging from 15\u201329 mm Hg. After 24 hours of INO at 20 ppm the ICP ranged from 12\u201320 mm Hg and the ABG was pH 7.47, PCO2 43 mm Hg, PaO2 165 mm Hg, BE 7.1 and HCO3 31 meq/L on AC 45, Vt 550, FiO2 95% and PEEP of 8 mm Hg. The INO was weaned over several days (there was no evidence of methemoglobinemia). The patient was discontinued from mechanical ventilation on hospital day 30. CT scan demonstrated no mass effect, but atrophy and hypodensity of the left temporal lobe. He was discharged to a rehabilitative traumatic brain injury unit on hospital day 34.

She also reported throat, chest, and epigastric pain and was unable to eat anything since the procedure due to her symptoms.\nHer past medical history included hypertension, hepatitis C, cirrhosis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, variceal hemorrhage, gall stones and Graves disease. She was on propranolol, lactulose, alprazolam and amlodipine at home. Social history was significant for heavy alcohol use for over 30 years, which she quit following an episode of variceal bleeding. She had no episodes of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding since her last EGD and banding. On physical examination, she was an ill-appearing female, had dry oral mucosa, tachycardic, had epigastric and RUQ tenderness with negative Murphy's sign, and no rebound or guarding. During the interview, she vomited small amounts of non-bloody white material several times.\nOn presentation, her laboratory tests were as follows: WBC 13.1, Hb/Hct 14/39.7, platelets 260; Na 152, K 3.6, Cl 112, CO2 22, BUN 30, Cr 0.87, glc 146; lipase 93, Alk Phos 113, AST/ALT 48/75, lactic acid 2.0 and drug screen was positive for propofol.\nThe patient was admitted for dehydration due to nausea and vomiting. She was started on IV fluids, anti-emetics, pain control and kept NPO (nothing by mouth). Her dyselectrolytemia improved following hydration and her diet was advanced on the following day. She could not tolerate oral intake and reported worsening dysphagia, nausea and vomiting. Over the course of next 2 days, the patient continued to have worsening dysphagia with no relief from anti-emetics. A barium swallow was administered which showed a complete obstruction of the distal esophagus (). The differential for obstruction was thought to be either from local edema from the banding procedure, impacted food or a hematoma from the procedure. An EGD was performed; the scope was advanced to 34 cm to the level of obstruction and it was noted to have a band with entrapped varix in the center of the lumen surrounded by fibrotic material closing off the rest of the lumen (). Several attempts were made with biopsy forceps to reopen the lumen that resulted in a small amount of bleeding and the scope was removed at this point. Conservative management of the patient continued, i.e., NPO with intravenous hydration and pain control. Her symptoms improved over the course of the next 3\u20134 days and she started tolerating diet advancement and was subsequently discharged.\nShe presented the next day with a recurrence of similar symptoms, i.e., dysphagia, abdominal pain and vomiting. A repeat barium swallow showed patency of the esophagus with a parallel channel that retained contrast much later than the initial swallow, suggestive of an esophageal tear with an intramural dissection of 6 cm to the level of gastro-esophageal junction ().\nThe patient was kept NPO with peripheral parenteral nutrition and close monitoring for possible esopheageal perforation. Over the course of the next several days, the diet was carefully advanced with inputs from gastroenterologist and surgical consultants.

The patient stated that she had taken her buspirone only as directed, with the last dose on the morning of the fluoxetine overdose, about six hours earlier. She specifically denied ingesting any additional buspirone or any other medications. She admitted to \u201cpurging\u201d herself daily for the last week. Other than some orthopedic surgical procedures, she denied any other significant past medical history, including seizures.\nThe paramedics arrived approximately 90 minutes post-ingestion and found the patient to be awake, alert, sitting up, and emotionally upset. The initial blood pressure was 142/palp and cardiac monitoring showed a sinus tachycardia at 120/minute. In the emergency department (ED) her vital signs were: temperature 37.2\u00b0C, pulse 91/min, blood pressure 132/72 mmHg, respirations 20/min, O2 saturation 99% on room air. The emergency physician noted the patient to be alert and oriented, but with slurred speech and slow verbal response time. The patient had a non-focal neurologic exam without tremor, rigidity, or hyperreflexia, and the remainder of the physical examination was without noted abnormalities. The patient was given 50 g of activated charcoal, and blood and urine samples were obtained for baseline values and for quantitative serum acetaminophen and salicylate measurements. Serum chemistries showed sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 4.2 mmol/L, chloride 105 mmol/L, bicarbonate 23 mmol/L, BUN 11 mg/dL, creatinine 0.6 mg/dL, glucose 81 mg/dL, salicylate 3.9 mg/dL, acetaminophen <1\u03bcg/mL, and ethanol 48 mg/dL. A qualitative urine pregnancy test was negative. An electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm of 97 beats per minute with normal intervals (QRS 88 msec, QTc 461 msec).\nApproximately three hours after the ingestion, the patient cried out and then experienced a generalized tonic-clonic seizure lasting 30 seconds witnessed by the ED personnel. The seizure resolved spontaneously, and the patient had a post-ictal period lasting five minutes. The patient received an intravenous loading dose of phenobarbital (620 mg [10mg/kg]) and was then transported without incident to a regional toxicology referral center.\nOn arrival to the intensive care unit, the patient was somnolent but easily arousable.

He was the first child of non-consanguineous marriage. Three weeks before admission he had received rotavirus, pneumococcal conjugate, pentavalent and inactivated polio vaccines. Before admission he developed fever and watery diarrhea that were treated symptomatically. Upon arrival, he was pale, somnolent and severely dehydrated; thus, intravenous saline solution was immediately infused. Initial laboratory results showed pH 7.32, bicarbonate 13 mEq/L, sodium 107 mEq/L, potassium 6.5 mEq/L and chloride 86 mEq/L with a glomerular filtration rate estimated by Schwartz formula (eGFR) of 55 ml/min/1.73 m2. He also had anemia without hemolytic forms on peripheral smear and thrombocytosis, normal lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, hypoalbuminemia and hypercholesterolemia []. During rehydration he suffered a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, which was attributed to severe hyponatremia. A magnetic resonance of the brain was normal. After 24 hrs the patient had generalized edema, blood pressure 114/70 mmHg and oligoanuria. Subsequent laboratory evaluations revealed improved renal function, microcytic hypochromic anemia without schistocytes and elevated platelets count. C3 level were decreased and C4 values were within the normal range. Urinalysis showed hematuria and proteinuria in nephrotic range []. Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated enlarged echogenic kidneys and ascites.\nBased on clinical and laboratory findings a diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome of the first year of life was initially established while decreased C3 led us to investigate a potential infectious origin. However, blood, urine and stool cultures resulted negative. Likewise, viral stool studies and serological tests for syphilis, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), hepatitis B and C, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, parvovirus, mycoplasma and Epstein \u2212 Barr virus were all negatives. At that time treatment included albumin plus furosemide and amlodipine for blood pressure control; however, as urine output did not improve a renal biopsy was performed at day 4 after admission. The same day, first of 3 daily boluses of methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/day) was given and peritoneal dialysis was started []. The biopsy showed focal increase in mesangial cellularity, coinciding with reduction in capillary lumens, collapse of glomerular tufts and presence of microthrombi. We did not observe an increase in the mesangial matrix or double contours of the capillary walls employing silver stain. By immunofluorescence, focal and segmental deposits of IgM alone were seen. Also, focal luminal dilation in proximal convoluted tubules, disruption of the brush border and detached epithelial cells, mild interstitial chronic inflammatory infiltrates and isolated microthrombi at inter-tubular capillaries were observed. These findings supported the diagnosis of thrombotic microangiopathy []. On this basis, a diagnosis of TMA was made, which was unusual since there were no laboratory data consistent with mechanical hemolysis except for a fall in platelets counts >25% from baseline. A diagnosis of aHUS was established, and daily plasma infusions were administered as a bridge until starting eculizumab therapy. He was immediately vaccinated against Neisseria Meningitidis and Streptococcus Pneumoniae too. Of note, after two plasma infusions his urine output improved leading to discontinuation of dialysis [].\nSimultaneously, the child was fully investigated. Accordingly, isolation of STEC, screening by polymerase chain reaction or detection of free Shiga toxin production in stools as well as lipopolysaccharides IgM antibodies for most common serotypes (O157, O145 and O121) resulted negative. ADAMTS 13 activity was normal (68%) and antibodies against ADAMTS 13 and CFH negative. Homocysteine level (6.2 \u03bcmol/l) was normal and antinuclear and anti-double stranded DNA antibodies were negative. Analysis of complement system corroborated a marked activation of the alternative pathway. C3 levels were persistently low (52 mg/dl) with normal C4 (15 mg/dl) concentration. Furthermore, serum functional activity of the classical pathway was 222 UH50/ml (normal value (NV) 180\u2212280) but the alternative pathway was >60 min (NV 7\u221212). C3 nephritic factor and C3 degradation products (C3d) were negative. Factor B 197 mg/L (NV 229\u2212394), factor H 409 mg/L (NV 329\u2212557), factor I 18 mg/L (NV 15\u221231) and properdin 16 mg/dL (NV 19\u221250) levels were within normal ranges. Screening genes encoding complement regulatory proteins, coagulation and other genes causative of aHUS by next generation sequencing (NGS) excluded pathogenic mutations in the following genes: ADAMTS13, C3, CD46/MCP, CFB, CFH, CFHR1, CFHR2, CFHR3, CFHR5, CFI, DGKE, MMACHC, PIGA, PLG, and THBD. Further, deletion/duplication of CFH, CFHR1, CFHR2, CFHR3, CFHR5 genes were ruled out by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), with an overall diagnostic specificity >99.9%. However, a heterozygous variant in the CFHR3 gene (c.613+2T>C) of uncertain significance was detected. In the following days the patient persisted with edema, but blood pressure became normal without medication and also he recovered the renal function and normalized complement levels. On day 20, treatment was switched to eculizumab at a dose of 300 mg per week for 2 weeks and then every 3 weeks adjusted to patient weight (7.4 kg). At the time of starting eculizumab he had normal renal function but nephrosis persisted []. Notably, after the second dose edema disappeared but hypoalbuminemia and massive proteinuria persisted. No adverse effects of eculizumab use were recorded. Because of familiar reasons the patient continued his follow-up in another country. After 6 months of treatment with eculizumab patient outcome was favorable, with normal renal function, remission of the nephrotic syndrome and without signs of TMA.", "Question": "What is the patient's anion gap in terms of mEq/L?", "LLM Answer": "8", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "8", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 107.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 86.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 13.0 mEq/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 107.0 mEq/L - (86.0 mEq/L + 13.0 mEq/L) = 8.0 mEq/L.

Acute kidney injury was addressed with aggressive fluid resuscitation as evident by increase in BUN of 33 mg/dL (11.78 mmol/L) and creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL (256.33 Umol/L). CT scan of abdomen performed to rule out ischemic colitis in the setting of progressive abdominal distention showed a diffuse pericolonic inflammation most pronounced at the rectosigmoid colon. Repeat endoscopy showed multiple ulcerated lesions of the gastric mucosa () with a biopsy that revealed necrotic debris with acute leukocytic exudate and numerous variably sized, 90-degree angulated fungal hyphae favoring mucormycosis (). Intravenous liposomal amphotericin-B (5 mg/kg/day at 60 kg weight) was started at a dose of 300 mg daily. Due to deterioration of renal function on the second day, treatment was switched to oral suspension of posaconazole at a dose of 400 mg twice a day for a total of 6 days (of note, no levels of posaconazole were drawn during hospital course). Repeat CT scan of the abdomen showed mild-to-moderate hydroureter with hydronephrosis and bladder wall thickening Figures and . Cystoscopy showed distorted anatomy of bladder lumen with multiple mounds of tissues all throughout the bladder most notable in the trigone with failure to locate ureteral orifices. Random biopsies taken from the bladder tissue also showed necrotic debris with active inflammatory and numerous variably sized angulated fungal hyphae consistent with Mucorales species. Once bladder biopsy confirmed Mucor spp, treatment was switched from posaconazole to intravenous isavuconazonium sulfate at a dose of 372 mg every eight hours for 48 hours as loading dose and then to an oral dose of 372 mg daily. Unfortunately, no sensitivity of the isolate to the newer triazoles was available. Surgical approach was considered; however, given patient's frail state and multiple comorbidities, such approach was deferred. Hydronephrosis significantly improved after placement of bilateral nephrostomy tubes. In addition, continuous bladder irrigation with amphotericin-B was given for localized bladder infection for a total of 5 days.

The symptoms started insidiously and progressed to a point where his exercise tolerance was reduced to a few steps. He was a plumber by profession and a lifetime nonsmoker. He denied wheezing, fever, night sweats, chest pain, and weight loss. He had no history of hemoptysis or bleeding from any other body sites. He did not use any medications and denied recent travel or sick contacts. On physical examination, he appeared to be in moderate respiratory distress, tachycardia, and tachypnea. His vital signs were blood pressure of 146/80 mmHg, heart rate of 116/min, respiratory rate of 34/min, temperature of 99.1 F, and saturating at 96% on 3 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula. He was oriented to time place and person and was found to be using his accessory muscles of respiration. His chest examination was notable for coarse crackles on the right side without any wheezing. His cardiac examination revealed tachycardia with a 3/6 pansystolic murmur best heard over the mitral area. The rest of his physical examination was unremarkable. His extremities were perfusing well and no peripheral edema was noted. His labs were notable for leukocytosis with neutrophilia (WBC: 12.7 k/mm3; neutrophils: 84%; eosinophils < 1%), his electrolytes were within normal range, and renal function was deranged with elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Na: 143 mEq/L; K: 4.6 mEq/L; Cl: 107 mEq/L; HCO3: 23 mEq/L; BUN: 40 mg/dL; creatinine: 1.5 mg/dL). His liver function tests (LFTs) were notable for elevated liver enzymes (AST: 48 U/L; ALT: 127 U/L). His arterial blood gas (ABG) was notable for a pH of 7.44, pCO2 of 31 mmHg, and a pO2 of 84 mmHg. His chest X-ray (CXR) showed right sided fluffy infiltrates (). He was admitted to the medical floor and started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for presumed community acquired pneumonia. However, his respiratory status deteriorated and he was transferred to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit where he was started on noninvasive mechanical ventilation (inspiratory pressure of 15 mmHg, expiratory pressure of 8 mmHg at 100% oxygen supplementation). An ABG showed a pH of 7.13, pCO2 of 64 mmHg, and a pO2 of 68 mmHg indicative of acute respiratory acidosis. His respiratory condition continued to deteriorate and he was intubated and mechanically ventilated with a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 mmHg and 50% oxygen supplementation. The patient's CXR revealed infiltrates which were more dense and confluent (). His labs were significant for up-trending leukocytosis (15 k/mm3). The patient's blood and urine cultures were negative. Tests for legionella, mycoplasma, HIV, and influenza were also negative. Autoimmune and vasculitis panels [antinuclear antibody (ANA), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), and antiglomerular basement membrane antibody (GBM)] tests were negative. An ABG after commencing mechanical ventilation showed a pH of 7.44, pCO2 of 31 mmHg, and a pO2 of 81 mmHg. Computed tomography (CT) of his chest confirmed the presence of dense infiltrates predominantly located in the right upper and middle lobes (Figures and ). Transthoracic echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 70%, mildly dilated left atrium, significant prolapse of the posterior mitral leaflet, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Right heart catheterization showed a pulmonary artery pressure of 56/23/35 mmHg (systolic/diastolic/mean); pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 22 mmHg, right atrial pressure of 4 mmHg, RV: 53/6 mmHg (systolic/diastolic); cardiac Index (by thermo dilution) of 2.1 liters/min/m2, and a pulmonary artery resistance of 9 wood units. Bronchoscopy revealed fresh blood in all the lobes with no obvious source and no endobronchial lesions. Sequential lavage from the right middle lobe was not progressively bloodier and hence less consistent with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Bronchoalveolar lavage was negative for cytology, acid fast bacillus (AFB), fungal stain, and pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). Thoracentesis yielded 150 cc of serous fluid with a pH of 7.6, LDH of 80 U/L, protein of 0.9 g/dL, glucose of 120 mg/dL, cell count with a differential of 55% of neutrophils, lymphocytes of 25%, and mesothelial cells of 10%. This was consistent with a transudative pleural effusion. The cytology and culture results of the fluid from thoracentesis were also negative. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed thickening and elongation of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve consistent with myxomatous degeneration, up to 1 cm in thickness at the margin of the anterior leaflet, prolapse of posterior leaflet into left atrium, aneurysm measuring 1 \u00d7 1.6 cm2 and perforation into left atrium and severe mitral regurgitation but no vegetations. The patient continued to have increased oxygen requirements and persistent hemoptysis and eventually underwent an emergent mitral valve repair. Perioperative TEE revealed hypertrophied right and left ventricles, normal right and left ventricular function with EF of 55%, mild anteroseptal wall hypokinesis, prolapse of the posterior mitral leaflet with a flail P3 segment, and severe mitral regurgitation with systolic flow reversal in right upper pulmonary vein (Figures and ). A final diagnosis of alveolar hemorrhage secondary to severe acute mitral regurgitation from myxomatous degeneration of mitral valve was made. Notably, his hemoglobin had decreased from 14.5 gm/dL to 11.7 gm/dL. Postoperative TEE did not show any evidence of mitral valve regurgitation ().

Although he reported a normal appetite, he was known to vomit frequently, particularly after a large meal. He had been diagnosed with hypokalemia and had been treated with potassium supplements at a previous hospital. However, because of persistent nausea and vomiting, he was transferred to our hospital for evaluation of hypokalemia.

On the eighth day of hospitalization, he developed abrupt onset polyuria with an increase in urine output from 70-80 cc/hr. to 200-225 cc/hr., totaling approximately 5.4 L over the next 24 hr. Urine osmolality was 193 mOsm/kg H2O, while his random urine sodium also increased from 23 to 179 mmol per liter urine.\nThe cause was not immediately apparent. His medications included aspirin, albuterol, isosorbide mononitrate, amiodarone, lisinopril, and metoprolol. CT scan of the head was negative for any intracranial processes ruling out a pituitary lesion as the cause of central DI. The patient was not on any medication known to cause nephrogenic DI and serum electrolytes were within normal limits. The patient was euvolemic and had normal serum glucose, BUN, and other organic acid levels ruling out osmotic diuresis as the cause of polyuria. Renal ultrasound was negative for any obstruction. Pertinent labs included BUN 16 mg/dL, creatinine 0.65 mg/dL, glucose 130 mg/dL, sodium 134 mmol/L, potassium 3.6 mmol/L, and calcium 8.8 mg/dL.

No other instigating cause was identified; we suspected central DI secondary to dexmedetomidine. A DDAVP stimulation test was planned as a therapeutic challenge for central DI, but 48 hours after the cessation of dexmedetomidine, the urine output spontaneously decreased to 50-100 cc/hr and urine osmolality increased to 306 mOsm/kgH2O so the test was not done. His serum osmolality also normalized after that. The patient was not rechallenged with dexmedetomidine. At no time did the patient develop hypernatremia due to strict replacement of carefully calculated water losses.\nIn the light of extensive negative workup and temporal relationship of polyuria with dexmedetomidine infusion and resolution of the polyuria with drug abstinence, we concluded that the polyuria was secondary to transient central Diabetes Insipidus secondary to dexmedetomidine infusion. The Naranjo Score for dexmedetomidine induced polyuria for this patient was 8, thereby putting the medication in the probable likelihood of causing the adverse reaction of polyuria [].", "Question": "What is the patient's Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)?

The only meals she used to have on a daily basis were milk and fruits for a period of 17 years, and even her daily meal intake rapidly decreased after her mother went abroad two weeks ago. This was because she appeared to be extremely dependent on her mother. She did not have any history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hepatitis previously. However, she had taken psychiatric medications for 6 months approximately 5 years ago. In addition, she also intermittently took medications for amenorrhea and osteoporosis.\nOn admission, her vital signs were: blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, pulse rate of 60 beats/min, respiration rate of 20 breaths/min, and body temperature of 36.5\u2103. She was alert, but looked chronically ill and cachexic. Her body weight was 30 kg and body mass index was 11.71 kg/m2. She had a severely dehydrated tongue, but her chest and abdomen physical examination showed no abnormalities. Her laboratory examinations were as follows; white blood cell 8,940/mm3, hemoglobin 15.8 g/dL, hematocrit 43.8%, platelet 70,000/mm3, random blood glucose 132 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine 35.9/0.44 mg/dL, total protein/albumin 5.6/3.6 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase 471/374 IU/L, total bilirubin 1.90 mg/dL, Na/K 127/2.6 mEq/L, Ca/P/Mg 8.5/5.3/1.6 mg/dL, total cholesterol 116 mg/dL, triglyceride 38 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol 74 mg/dL, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol <10 mg/dL, T3 0.43 ng/mL (0.78-1.82 ng/mL), free T4 0.94 ng/mL (0.85-1.86 ng/mL), thyroid stimulating hormone 1.71 mIU/L (0.17-4.05 mIU/L), adrenocoticotropic hormone 11.44 pg/mL (6.00-56.70 pg/mL), cortisol 17.40 ug/dL (9.41-26.06 ug/dL), and aldosterone 31.66 pg/mL (40-102 pg/mL). Initial cardiac biomarkers were elevated as follows; creatine kinase-MB 154.30 ng/mL (0-5 ng/mL), troponin-I 2.580 ng/mL (0-0.78 ng/mL) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide 8,963 pg/mL (0-155 pg/mL). Her chest X-ray and abdomen computed tomography showed no significant lesions associated with epigastic pain. Initial electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm (60 beats/min), prolonged corrected QT interval (543 ms), pathologic Q waves in II, III, aVF and V1-V3, inverted T waves in II, III and aVF and poor R progression in precordial leads (). Echocardiogram revealed large akinetic areas around the apical, inferior, anterior and lateral sides with hypercontraction of the basal segments, linear echogenic mural thrombus, pericardial effusion, and a reduction of ejection fraction to 36% (). Therefore, we strongly suspected that she was SICMP because of her characteristic echocardiograhic findings.\nOnly standard medical treatment was given to the patient since she and her guardian refused to receive a coronary angiogram. Therefore, we started the treatment with low molecular weight heparin, and nutrition support with immediate multi-systemic interventions. Psychiatric consultation was also accompanied by medical therapy. After three days, we stopped anticoagulation therapy due to aggravated thrombocytopenia and prolonged prothrombin time (PT). Overall, her daily oral intake increased together with her body weight, 33 kg compared to 30 kg in the beginning. Electrolyte imbalance, liver dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia were also normalized. Two weeks later, the next follow-up echocardiogram indicated a significant improvement of the LV ejection fraction (42%) and wall motion abnormalities. On the other hand, apical mural thrombosis still remained and pericardial effusion increased (). On the next follow-up electrocardiogram, the corrected QT interval decreased to 453 ms. Furthermore, pathologic Q waves, inverted T waves and poor R progression observed in the initial ECG disappeared (). However, she and her guardian strongly insisted on discharging from the hospital against the clinician's recommendation. Although appointments with cardiology and psychiatry departments were arranged with continuing mental support and follow-up echocardiogram, she never came back to the hospital after her discharge.", "Question": "What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

On admission, her general appearance was acutely ill and generally edematous. A physical examination revealed that her blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg, her heart rate was 90/min, her respiratory rate was 22/min, and her body temperature was 36.5\u2103. Her breathing sounds were clear, and her heartbeat was regular without murmur. A subsequent examination of her lower limbs showed asymmetric bilateral pretibial pitting edema predominantly in the left lower limb. In contrast, the right lower limb was less edematous and had very weak popliteal and pedal pulses. Delayed capillary refilling was also found in the right toes. The Homan's sign was negative.\nSerum laboratory findings at admission were as follows: white blood cell count of 5,300/mm3, hematocrit of 39.5% with hemoglobin of 13.1 g/dl, and platelet count of 286,000/mm3. The serum sodium concentration was 141 mEq/L, the potassium concentration was 4.1 mEq/L, the chloride concentration was 104 mEq/L, and total CO2 was 28 mEq/L. The blood urea nitrogen concentration was 12.1 mg/dl, the creatinine concentration was 0.86 mg/dl, the serum total protein concentration was 4.3 g/dl, the albumin concentration was 2.2 g/dl, the total cholesterol concentration was 349.4 mg/dl, the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration was 214.4 mg/dl, the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration was 111 mg/dl, and the triglyceride concentration was 120.1 mg/dl. The results of liver function tests were normal. The coagulation profile showed an activated partial thromboplastin time of 32.0 s, prothrombin time of 9.7 s, anti-thrombin III value of 82% (70-120%), protein C activity of 143% (70-130%), and protein S activity of 65% (58.7-119.2%). The anti-nuclear antibody titer was less than 1:40, the anti-double-stranded DNA titer was 30.9 IU/ml, the C3 level was 158 mg/dl, and the C4 level was 19 mg/dl. Anti-cardiolipin immunoglobulin G, anti-cardiolipin immunoglobulin M, and lupus anticoagulant were all negative. Urinalysis revealed 3+ proteinuria (spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio was 10.9 g/g creatinine; spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio was 7,406.2 mg/g creatinine) and trace hematuria (1-3 red blood cells/high-power field). To investigate the etiology of nephrotic syndrome, an urgent renal biopsy was performed.\nThereafter, although she had no risk factors for thrombosis such as immobilization, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, morbid obesity, or a recent orthopedic or gynecologic surgery, to rule out arterial thrombosis of the right lower extremity, lower extremity computed tomography (CT) angiography was performed. The CT imaging revealed that the right superficial femoral artery was occluded and there was no identifiable proximal source of thromboembolism in other large arteries (). On the basis of these CT angiographic findings, right lower extremity angiography was performed, which revealed a total occlusion of the right superficial femoral artery (). For the treatment of this condition, balloon dilatation was initially tried at the distal superficial femoral artery but failed. Hence, thrombectomy was performed with the Fogarty balloon catheter and the thrombi were successfully aspirated. After the interventional treatment, a good distal arterial flow was reestablished (). Thereafter, warfarin (5 mg/day) as an anticoagulant and corticosteroid treatments were initiated.\nSubsequent transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiographic studies showed no evidence of intracardiac thrombus, vegetation, or other structural abnormalities including patent foramen ovale. Quantitation of proteinuria was confirmed by using a 24-hour urine collection that showed 10.2 g/day of protein excretion and 7.8 g/day of albumin excretion, respectively. Afterwards, with administration of warfarin and corticosteroid, the patient had nearly completely recovered from the edema and claudication and was discharged. The renal pathologic results were consistent with minimal change disease ( and ). Two months after discharge, her urine protein-to-creatinine ratio decreased to less than 0.1 g/g creatinine, her serum albumin level was maintained at 4.1 g/dl, and she had no further symptoms or signs of arterial thrombosis.", "Question": "What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

During the year or two before her admission, the angina became more frequent and occurred on minimal exertion. Pain radiating to both shoulders and upper arms frequently accompanied the angina episodes.\nAfter admission, the angina was controlled by bed rest and intensive medical treatment with beta blocking and calcium channel blocking drugs and sublingual nitrates. There was no history of hypertention, cigarette smoking, use of alcohol, or birth control pills.\nUpon admission, her temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, pulse per minute and respiration 16 per minute. The blood pressure was 130/90 mmHg.\nOn examination, the patient appeared acutely ill. However, the head and neck were normal; the jugular vein was not distended. The lungs were clear. The heart sounds were regular; no murmurs or pericardial friction rub was heard. The abdomen was normal; no organ or mass was palpated. There was no peripheral edema, clubbing or cyanosis.

There was no family history of liver disease, diabetes, or hypercholesterolemia. Since birth, her general health had been good; however, hepatomegaly was noticed during a routine health care visit and therefore, at 5 years of age, the patient was referred to our hospital. At that time, her height was 100.6 cm (-2.0 SD as compared to a normal Japanese girl) and her weight was 14.1 kg (-1.8 SD as compared to a normal Japanese girl) (BMI= 14.1 kg/m2). A physical examination revealed hepatomegaly with moderate elevation of serum transaminases. Jaundice and splenomegaly were absent. She was admitted for further evaluation . Laboratory findings revealed liver dysfunction and hypercholesterolemia (AST 211 IU/L, ALT 321 IU/L, lactate dehydrogenase 914 IU/L , alkaline phosphatase 971 IU/L, leucine aminopeptidase 272 IU/L, ?-glutamyl transpeptidase 10 IU/L, total cholesterol 207 mg/dL, HDL-cholesterol 45 mg/dL, triglyceride 142 mg/dL, and total bile acid 5.5 mg/L). Serum anti-nuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, and anti-DNA antibody were negative. Her fasting blood glucose was 91 mg/dL and within the normal range. Glucosuria was detected; however, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) showed normal glucose levels and insulin responses (). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed hepatomegaly with diffuse low density and no mass, suggesting fatty liver change. Ultrasonography and CT demonstrated no abnormalities in other organs. It was suspected that the patient had some degree of liver disease, and a liver biopsy was performed. Biopsy specimens showed vacuolar degeneration of individual hepatocytes and macrovesicular steatosis (). Hepatitis, drug-induced disease, and congenital metabolic diseases were excluded, and the origin of the liver disease remained unknown. As the cause of liver disease was not determined, we treated the patient for hypercholesterolemia with ethyl icosapentate, which is not hepatotoxic (). Post-treatment, her serum cholesterol level had decreased to almost within the normal range. Regarding hepatic dysfunction, the patient\u2019s serum transaminase levels were reduced but continued to fluctuate at the upper end of the normal range. A CT scan showed improvement of fatty change in the liver. When the patients was 9 years of age, it was noticed during a routine laboratory evaluation that she had elevated HbA1c (7.3%) and she was reevaluated for diabetes. At this time, her height was 127.4 cm and her body weight was 25.7 kg (these measurements correspond to -1.0 SD for a normal Japanese girl). BMI was calculated as 15.9 kg/m2. The second OGTT showed reductions in both glucose tolerance and insulinogenic index (). The peak level of serum C-peptide after glucagon stimulation remained normal (3.9 ng/mL, normal range >2.0 ng/mL). Islet cell antibodies (ICAs) and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody were not detected in the serum. At this time, she was suspected to have MODY3 because of liver disease and negative auto-antibodies. It has been reported that sulphonylureas are effective in the treatment of patients with MODY3 (); however, the use of sulphonylureas in children is not approved by the health insurance authorities in Japan. Since the patient had a reduced insulinogenic index, insulin treatment in a total daily dose of 9 units prior to each meal was initiated. Since that time, the patient\u2019s diabetes has been under good control and her liver dysfunction has been normalized. She is now 20 years old, and her total daily insulin requirement has increased to 36 units, while her HbA1c levels range from 6.5% to 7%. We could not obtain patient and parental consent for a second biopsy.\nBecause the clinical course led to a probable diagnosis of MODY, we analyzed HNF1A, 4A and -1B by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing, according to a previous report (). Sequence analysis of HNF1A identified a heterozygous mutation at the consensus splice donor site of intron 9, which has been previously reported in a MODY3 family (). Neither of the patient\u2019s parents had this base change, indicating that the mutation occurred de novo.

Blood samples showed a glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 8.9% (74 mmol/mol) and a fasting plasma glucose of 7.3 mmol/l. LFTs showed an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 196 U/l (reference range 10\u201345 U/l), an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 132 U/l (reference range 15\u201335 U/l) and an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 127 U/l (reference range 35\u2013105 U/l). Lipids were elevated: total cholesterol 4.5 mmol/l, high-density lipoprotein 0.84 mmol/l, low-density lipoprotein 2.4 mmol/l and triglycerides 2.86 mmol/l. Bilirubin, international normalized ratio and albumin were within normal ranges. The patient had no history of alcohol abuse nor did she take any herbal drug. Abdominal ultrasound revealed increased echogenicity and poor visualization of the intrahepatic vessel walls, suggesting diffuse hepatic steatosis.\nStatins were discontinued and the patient was strongly encouraged to be compliant with her metformin treatment (1,000 mg twice-daily). In addition neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin was initiated. The daily dose of basal insulin was gradually increased to 30 IU once daily.\nAfter 8 weeks on metformin and insulin, HbA1c had markedly improved to 6.3%, but LFTs except for ALP remained elevated (ALT 133 U/l, AST 76 U/l, ALP 69 U/l). The patient was then scheduled for a liver biopsy, which showed hepatic fat infiltration involving more than 66% of hepatocytes, ballooned hepatocytes, lobular inflammation as well as pericellular and periportal fibrosis. The histological diagnosis was NASH with a NAFLD activity score of 5 (score range 0\u20138) and a fibrosis score of 2 (score range 0\u20134) (fig. ). Treatment with subcutaneous injections of the GLP-1R agonist liraglutide was initiated. The initial dose was 0.6 mg once daily subcutaneously. The dose was increased with weekly increments of 0.6\u20131.8 mg once daily during the following weeks. Liraglutide was well tolerated with no side effects such as nausea or vomiting. Insulin was gradually reduced and discontinued after 7 weeks.\nAfter 46 weeks of treatment with liraglutide, total weight loss was 16 kg, LFTs were in the lower normal range (ALT 29 U/l, AST 25 U/l, ALP 67 U/l), glycemic control was excellent (HbA1c 5.6%) and the lipid profile was normalized without statin treatment. Repeat abdominal ultrasound showed diminished echogenicity, suggesting an overall reduction in steatosis. A repeated liver biopsy confirmed decreased hepatic fat infiltration (involving 40\u201350% of hepatocytes), no ballooned hepatocytes and only distinct lobular inflammation (fig. ). The histology was no longer consistent with NASH, but pericellular and periportal fibrosis were still present (NAFLD activity score 3, fibrosis score 2).\nTo investigate the expression of hepatic GLP-1Rs in the present case, the baseline and the post-treatment liver biopsy were compared to liver tissue from another patient with type 2 diabetes but without steatosis, using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. No biopsies showed expression of GLP-1Rs.", "Question": "What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration? Please outuput your answer in terms of mg/dL.", "LLM Answer": "93.6", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "109.12", "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the patient's LDL cholestrol, apply the following formula: LDL cholesterol = total cholesterol - HDL - (triglycerides / 5), where the units for total cholestrol, HDL cholestrol, and triglycerides are all mg/dL.\nThe concentration of total cholestrol is 4.5 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mmol to mg. The mass of total cholestrol is 4.5 mmol. To convert 4.5 mmol of total cholestrol to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 4.5 mmol total cholestrol * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.005 mol total cholestrol. To convert from mol total cholestrol to grams, multiply by the molar mass 386.654 g/mol, which will give 0.005 mol total cholestrol * 386.654 g/mol = 1.933 g total cholestrol. To convert 1.933 g of total cholestrol to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 1.933 g total cholestrol * 1000.0 mg/g = 1933.0 mg total cholestrol. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 1933.0 mg total cholestrol/10.0 dL = 193.3 mg total cholestrol/dL. The concentration value of 4.5 mmol total cholestrol/L converts to 193.3 mg total cholestrol/dL. \nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 0.84 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mmol to mg. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 0.84 mmol. To convert 0.84 mmol of hdl cholestrol to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 0.84 mmol hdl cholestrol * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.00084 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert from mol hdl cholestrol to grams, multiply by the molar mass 386.654 g/mol, which will give 0.00084 mol hdl cholestrol * 386.654 g/mol = 0.325 g hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.325 g of hdl cholestrol to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.325 g hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mg/g = 325.0 mg hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 325.0 mg hdl cholestrol/10.0 dL = 32.5 mg hdl cholestrol/dL. The concentration value of 0.84 mmol hdl cholestrol/L converts to 32.5 mg hdl cholestrol/dL. \nThe concentration of triglycerides is 2.86 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of triglycerides from mmol to mg. The mass of triglycerides is 2.86 mmol. To convert 2.86 mmol of triglycerides to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 2.86 mmol triglycerides * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.003 mol triglycerides. To convert from mol triglycerides to grams, multiply by the molar mass 861.338 g/mol, which will give 0.003 mol triglycerides * 861.338 g/mol = 2.584 g triglycerides. To convert 2.584 g of triglycerides to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 2.584 g triglycerides * 1000.0 mg/g = 2584.0 mg triglycerides. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 2584.0 mg triglycerides/10.0 dL = 258.4 mg triglycerides/dL. The concentration value of 2.86 mmol triglycerides/L converts to 258.4 mg triglycerides/dL. \nPlugging in these values will give us 193.3 mg/dL - 32.5 mg/dL - (258.4/5) mg/dL = 109.12 mg/dL.\nThe patients concentration of LDL cholestrol is 109.12 mg/dL.", "Result": "Incorrect"}

In addition, the patient had pale and dry skin. Heart rate was regular and systolic murmur was heard at the apex. Breath sounds were decreased with inspiratory crackles on bilateral lung bases. The patient also had bilateral presence of non-pitting edema of the foot and ankle. On chest X-ray, the patient had cardiomegaly with perihilar congestion and blunting of both costophrenic angles. These findings are suggestive of pleural effusion (). On electrocardiographic findings, the patient had normal sinus rhythm with low voltage of limb leads, interventricular conduction delay and non-specific ST-segment and T-wave changes (). On clinical laboratory examinations, the patient showed elevated serum levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (5026 pg/mL) and normal range of cardiac enzymes. Renal functions were normal with blood urea nitrogen of 14.8 mg/dL and creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL. Lipid panel showed total cholesterol 231 mg/dL, triglyceride 188 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 34 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 88 mg/dL. Liver function test showed elevated serum levels of transaminases with total bilirubin 1.34 mg/dL, aspartate transaminase 402 IU/L, alanine transaminase 340 IU/L and alkaline phosphatase 44 IU/L. On complete blood counts, the patient had white blood cell counts 9260/mm3 with 56% neutrophils, hemoglobin 10.8 g/dL and platelets 190000/mm3. Serum electrolytes showed [Na+] = 120 meq/L, suggesting hyponatremia, and [K+] = 4.3 meq/L. Serum creatinine kinase was elevated (2738 U/L). On echocardiography, the patient had a dilated left ventricular cavity with a diastolic dimension of 6.1 cm, a decreased global systolic function with an ejection fraction of 16% and functional mitral regurgitation of moderate grade (). The patient had a ratio of transmitral early peak velocity (E) to septal mitral annulus velocity (E') of 13. The patient was started on loop diuretic therapy using furosemide and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril) for heart failure. On day 2, the patient underwent thyroid function test. This showed that the patient had elevated serum levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (100 \u00b5IU/mL) (reference range: 0.5-5 \u00b5IU/mL), decreased serum levels of T3 (60 ng/dL) (reference range: 80-180 ng/dL) and decreased serum levels of free T4 (0.054 ng/dL) (reference range: 0.7-1.9 ng/dL). Furthermore, the patient underwent additional tests to reveal the cause of hypothyroidism. This showed that the patient was positive for thyroglobulin antibody but negative for anti-microsomal one. On thyroid ultrasonography, the patient had an atrophic thyroid gland with hypoechoic parenchyma with two small nodules of 5 mm and 8 mm in size in the right lobe. On Tc 99-mm radionuclide thyroid scan, there was an increased uptake in the above two small nodules. On fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the nodules, the patient had adenomatous hyperplasia on lymphocytic thyroiditis background (). These findings were suggestive of Hashimoto's thyroiditis accompanied by atrophic autoimmune thyroiditis. Based on these findings, the patient was started on thyroid hormone replacement with thyroxine. Thyroxine dose was titrated up to 50 \u00b5g/day after two weeks and then up to 100 \u00b5g/day. This was followed by the adjustment of thyroxine dose based on thyroid functions.

The laboratory test results were as follows: complete blood cell count: hemoglobin 15.3, platelets 371; cholesterol profile: cholesterol 177 mg/dl, triglycerides 296, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 35 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein 83 mg/dl, ratio of cholesterol to HDL 5.1; anti-beta-2 glycoprotein I antibodies, anticardiolipin (immunoglobin G and M), activated partial thromboplastin time, Venereal Disease Research Laboratory, Factor V Leiden, activated protein C and S tests were all negative.\nAn urgent neuroimaging protocol for stroke including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance image angiography (angio-MRI) was carried out. Axial and coronal trace diffusion-weighted images obtained 20 hours after the onset of symptoms showed bilateral areas of high signal intensity compatible with thalamic infarcts restricted to both paramedian thalamic territories and right periaqueductal gray matter (Figure ). The posterior circulation was patent on the angio-MRI, including the tip of the basilar artery and both posterior cerebral arteries. Further evaluation with an aim of defining the etiology of the stroke revealed a patent foramen ovale on transesophageal echocardiography with spontaneous passage of contrast bubbles from the right auricle to the left cavities. Clot formation was found in the wall of the right auricle.\nThe state of consciousness spontaneously resolved during the third week after the ictus, although fluctuant periods of somnolence and obtundation continued. Administration of modafinil (100 mg twice a day) markedly improved his state of alertness, evidencing important neuropsychologic impairment with hyperphagia, anosognosia and emotional lability with depressive symptoms. There was improvement in the right third cranial nerve function with adequate eye opening and orthophoric condition, although bilateral limitation in vertical gaze movement was persistent. The patient was discharged after two weeks of hospitalization and was being followed up by our outpatient clinic at the time of writing.

The family history was also negative for PAD and myocardial infarction. He was taking no medications at the time of evaluation. He does not consume alcohol and has never smoked cigarettes or used illicit drugs.\nPhysical examination revealed a heart rate of 72 beats per minute, left brachial blood pressure of 114/74 mmHg, and body mass index of 25.1 kg/m2. Lower extremities showed no pigment changes, edema, tenderness, and had full range of motion. The right femoral, popliteal, and posterior tibial pulses were palpable 2+. The left femoral artery was palpable 1+. The left popliteal, posterior tibial, and bilateral dorsalis pedis pulses were nonpalpable. The left popliteal and posterior tibial arteries had a weak, biphasic Doppler signal and the bilateral dorsalis pedis arteries had no appreciable Doppler signal. No carotid or abdominal bruits were noted, and the remainder of the physical exam was unremarkable. Laboratory values were within the normal range: total cholesterol 161 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein 58 mg/dL, triglycerides 52 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein 90 mg/dL, hemoglobin (Hb) 16.1 g/dL, platelet 218,000/uL, creatinine 0.79 mg/dL, glucose 80 mg/dL, HbA1c 5.2%, prothrombin time 12.8 seconds, and international normalized ratio 1.0. Left ABI was 0.76 at rest and 0.40 after five minutes of exercise. Arterial duplex demonstrated biphasic waveforms from the left common and profunda femoris arteries with no stenosis. The left superficial femoral artery had bi/monophasic waveforms with >75% stenosis at the proximal thigh. The popliteal and tibial arteries had bi/monophasic flow without stenosis. A computed tomography (CT) angiogram with contrast and bilateral lower extremity runoff demonstrated normal arteries of the abdomen and right lower extremity (Figure -C). The left common femoral artery was significantly smaller than the right but otherwise normal. The left proximal to mid superficial femoral artery was severely diseased with extensive calcifications causing near-complete occlusion with distal reconstitution (Figure -C). The left proximal profunda femoris artery was completely occluded with lack of flow for the first 45 mm with distal reconstitution (Figure -F). The left popliteal, tibial, peroneal, and dorsalis pedis arteries were normal with excellent runoff. There were no signs of embryological abnormalities.\nSurgical exploration confirmed that the left common femoral artery was diminutive but soft with a palpable pulse. The origin of the profunda femoris artery was obstructed with a smooth, hard lesion (Figure ), which was removed with local endarterectomy and confirmed by pathology as a calcified plaque. The distal profunda femoris was followed and was found to be extensively full of the calcified plaque with no back bleeding, so a profundaplasty or complete profundal bypass was decided against, and a bovine pericardial patch was placed. Next, the left great saphenous vein was harvested and used for a left femoral to left above-knee popliteal artery bypass. A 2+ palpable pulse was noted in both the graft and the left above-knee popliteal artery. A 1+ weak pulse was noted at the left posterior tibial artery.

She reported no autoimmune disease, was not pregnant or in the early post-partum period, nor did she take an oral contraceptive pill or report any history of drug abuse. She was also not menstruating at time of admission. Risk factors for coronary artery disease were not found. At presentation, her blood pressure was 116/70 mm Hg and her heart rate was 75 beats/min. Her physical examination results were within normal limits without murmurs, rubs or gallops. There were no manifestations of connective tissue disease and the hematologic, renal parameters were normal. The initial electrocardiogram showed nonspecific T wave inversion in leads III, aVF () and the initial chest X-ray was normal without cardiomegaly or pulmonary edema. Cardiac enzymes were elevated with initial serum troponin T of 0.07 mcg/L (normal <0.014 mcg/L), creatinine kinase (CK) of 138 U/L (normal <215 U/L) and CK-MB of 8.49 mcg/L (normal <3.77 mcg/L).

The right coronary artery (RCA) and left circumflex artery images were normal, but there was diffuse stenotic lesion of the mid left anterior descending artery (LAD) with up to 80% luminal narrowing. The lesion slightly improved after intracoronary injection of nitroglycerine (). To evaluate the etiology of the stenotic lesion, in terms of spasm, atherosclerosis or other cause, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS, Boston scientific Co., CA, USA) was performed. IVUS showed an isolated dissection flap composed of all of the intima and media, including the internal elastic lamina and external elastic lamina, compressed by hematoma in the false lumen at the bifurcation edge of the mid LAD and diagonal branch. The dissection entry tear site to the false lumen was not detected on angiogram.

Her family history was negative for lipid disorders, dermatologic conditions, and chronic inflammatory conditions.\nThe physical examination revealed multiple flesh colored to slightly pink, flat-topped, smooth papules lined up in a row in the periungual skin on every finger of both hands, as well as the margin of the nares, forehead, and scalp. The musculoskeletal examination demonstrated unequivocal polyarthritis. There was swelling, loss of range of motion, and pain with movement in both elbows. There was synovial thickening and pain with flexion in both wrists. There were flexion contractures of the second and third proximal interphalangeal joints of both hands. Effusions and synovial thickening were present in both knees.\nLaboratory results showed a normal complete blood count, hepatic profile, renal profile, and lipid profile (cholesterol 128 mg/dL, low density lipoprotein 83 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein 30 mg/dL, triglycerides 75 mg/dL). Lactate, uric acid, serum sterol, and urine organic acid levels (desmosterol, lathosterol, campesterol and sitosterol) were all within normal limits. ESR and CRP were within normal limits. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed no significant abnormalities. Lyme serology, anti-nuclear antibodies, and rheumatoid factor were negative. PPD was negative.\nBilateral hand X-rays demonstrated mild diffuse osteopenia without periosteal reaction, soft tissue swelling in the digits, most striking at the base of the fingernails and a radiolucency at the base of the left third proximal phalanx. A CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was unremarkable. CT scan of the neck showed multiple, less than 2 cm lymph nodes. A glenohumeral joint effusion was noted as well.\nSkin biopsies were obtained from the nail fold and scalp. The histology sections showed a dome-shape lesion with dermal infiltrate composed of foamy histiocytes and a few admixed lymphocytes (fig ). Multinucleated giant cells and Touton type giant cells were not observed. There was upward migration of cells with clear, foamy, and vacuolated cytoplasm within the overlying epidermis. PAS stains were negative for glycogen deposition and fungal organisms. AFB stains were negative. Immunostaining with CD68 was positive, and CD1a stained only a few intraepidermal and rare dermal cells. Factor XIIIa stained a few scattered cells. These biopsies where read by multiple pathologists as consistent with papular xanthoma. Additional biopsies of synovium and additional skin nodule both showed foamy histiocytes with scattered lymphocytes arranged in sheets. Cytoplasm ranged from clear to bubbly to finely granular. CD68 and lysozyme stained strongly positive in histiocytes. Formal evaluation of the patient by an ophthalmologist, oncologist, and metabolic specialist revealed no additional findings.\nThe child was diagnosed with MRH based on her clinical presentation, even though histopathology was not classic for this disorder, and followed in pediatric rheumatology clinic. She was started on naproxen without major improvement in the joint complaints; methotrexate was then added at a dose of 5 mg (0.4 mg/kg) by mouth once a week and later increased to 7.5 mg (0.6 mg/kg) subcutaneously once a week without major improvement. Hydroxychloroquine 75 mg (6.25 mg/kg) by mouth per day was added. Subcutaneous nodules of about 2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 2 cm were noted on the upper portion her arms bilaterally in the region of the axilla and diagnosed as synovial cysts by ultrasound. X ray of the shoulders revealed subtendinous erosion of bone in the humerus and distal clavicle remodeling (fig ). Oral prednisone 1.7 mg/kg/day was started, and there was almost complete resolution of the xanthomatous lesions and moderate improvement in her arthritis. Prednisone was tapered to 1 mg/kg.\nHowever, she continued to have multiple joint effusions and decreased range of motion in her PIP joints. Therefore, etanercept was added at a dose of 20 mg (1.25 mg/kg) subcutaneously every week. Methotrexate was increased to 12.5 mg (0.8 mg/kg). She had a partial initial response to etanercept with some improvement in the range of motion of her MCP's and wrists. However, after 3 months on etanercept, the patient had significant ongoing polyarthritis, so the etanercept dose was increased to 25 mg (1.5 mg/kg), and methotrexate was increased to 15 mg (0.9 mg/kg). As her prednisone was tapered very slowly, a few tiny xanthomatous lesions reappeared. Due to worsening polyarthritis, etanercept was discontinued, and infliximab was started at a dose of 10 mg/kg intravenously. After 2 infusions given 2 weeks apart, the patient was noted to have improvement with resolution of multiple joint effusions and improved range of motion. In addition, all xanthomas disappeared. The infliximab infusions were continued every 4 weeks. Methotrexate was continued at 0.9 mg/kg subcutaneously per week.

Prior to admission, she required help with high-order activities of daily living, such as heavy housework; she was relatively independent with activities of daily living, receiving some support from her family for the same, but she rarely left her house. This put her in the category of \u201cmildly frail\u201d on the Clinical Frailty Scale 5.[] Her past medical history included hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diet-controlled diabetes mellitus-type 2. Her vital signs following initial assessment were: Heart rate 94/min, blood pressure 104/71 mmHg, respiratory rate 19/min, temperature 36.2\u00b0 C and oxygen saturation 92% on 6 L O2 delivered through nasal cannula. Her laboratory results revealed: White cell count 3.4 \u00d7 10 9/L (normal range: 4.0\u201311.0 \u00d7 109/L), neutrophils 2.43 \u00d7 10 9/L (2.0\u20137.7), lymphocyte 0.82 \u00d7 10 9/L (0.8\u20133.4), C-reactive protein (CRP) 100 mg/L (0\u20138), urea 4.7 mmol/L (3.0\u20137.6), and creatinine of 62 umol/L (65\u2013114). Chest X-ray (CXR) showed bilateral infiltrates that were most apparent in the left middle and right lower zones [].\nShe was initially managed as suspected COVID-19 pneumonia with an exacerbation of COPD. On day-3 of admission she deteriorated significantly; she became cyanosed and tachypnoeic at 30 breaths per minute and 15 L/min oxygen via a mask with a reservoir bag was required to achieve oxygen saturation of 90%. Molecular testing confirmed the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on nasopharyngeal swab, confirming the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Arterial blood gas analysis on 15 L/min oxygen via a mask with a reservoir bag showed: pH 7.49, pC02\u20134.9 kPa, and pO2\u20134.2 kPa, in keeping with severe lung injury. She was commenced on CPAP of 10 cm H20 with 60% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). Following initiation of CPAP, she improved symptomatically with reduction in respiratory rate and achieved saturations at 92% on 60% FiO2. The CPAP management strategy was to titrate pressures up to a maximum of 15 cm H20 with an aim to keep FiO2 requirements to 60% or less, as far as possible, with target saturation of 88%\u201392%.[] A do-not-attempt resuscitation order was placed and agreed with the family, which included the decision that the patient would not be suitable for invasive ventilation through an endotracheal tube; this was based on the patient's premorbid functional status and perceived poor prognosis with these interventions.\nOn day 4 of the admission, her oxygen requirements increased to an Fio2 of 90%, and she was CPAP dependent on 15 cm H2O, rapidly desaturating when it was removed. A nasogastric (NG) tube was inserted to maintain both nutrition and hydration. A repeat CXR showed worsening consolidation in both lungs consistent with worsening COVID-19 pneumonia []. Rising inflammatory markers prompted the initiation of empirical antibiotics (Moxifloxacin) to cover possible secondary bacterial infection []. The patient's condition initially stabilized; by day 10, she was weaned to overnight CPAP only, maintaining adequate oxygen saturation on 2 L/min of oxygen delivered through nasal cannula and the feeding NG-tube was removed.\nDespite initial improvement, she experienced a second phase of clinical deterioration on day 12 (20 days from onset of symptoms) with worsening respiratory parameters (respiratory rate 37 and oxygen saturations falling to 86% on 5 L/min oxygen through nasal cannulae). CPAP was recommenced with titration of pressure and FiO2 as earlier described. A feeding NG-tube was reinserted. A repeat CXR [] showed worsening infiltrates bilaterally, suggestive of ARDS and there was a concomitant rise in CRP levels []. Along with raised CRP levels, interleukin-6 levels were raised at 50.1 pg/mL (0\u20137), ferritin levels were 302 ug/L and D-dimer 4236 ng/mL. Although the clinical picture was in keeping with worsening COVID-19, empirical antibiotic therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam was restarted to cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia. However, multiple sputum and blood cultures did not demonstrate growth of pathogens. The patient slowly improved and was again weaned from CPAP with this being discontinued on day 27 of admission, completing 24 days of CPAP treatment in total. Clinical improvement was reflected in the decline of CRP levels to 11 mg/L from a high of 314 mg/L. Interleukin-6 levels also decreased to 14.2 pg/ml. She was discharged after 30 days of treatment for COVID-19 at which time she no longer required supplementary oxygen and was close to her normal premorbid state.

We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of BUN from mmol to mg. The mass of BUN is 4.7 mmol. To convert 4.7 mmol of BUN to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 4.7 mmol BUN * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.005 mol BUN. To convert from mol BUN to grams, multiply by the molar mass 28.02 g/mol, which will give 0.005 mol BUN * 28.02 g/mol = 0.14 g BUN. To convert 0.14 g of BUN to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.14 g BUN * 1000.0 mg/g = 140.0 mg BUN. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 140.0 mg BUN/10.0 dL = 14.0 mg BUN/dL. The concentration value of 4.7 mmol BUN/L converts to 14.0 mg BUN/dL.

Peritoneal dialysis was discontinued and CVVH was undertaken at 32 mL/kg/h for renal insufficiency. The patient became oriented. Arterial blood gases showed normal pH (7.43), improved PaO2 (88.6 mm Hg), normal PaCO2 (36.5 mm Hg), and HCO3\u2013 (23.5 mmol/L). However, fever persisted (39.5\u00b0C), and the patient had difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation.\nAbdominal computed tomography (CT) at day 5 showed a hypointense shadow in the left hepatic lobe (61 mm \u00d7 56 mm) with an indistinct border (). Liver abscess was confirmed upon ultrasound-guided drainage. The culture revealed Klebsiella pneumonia that was sensitive to third-generation cephalosporin and imipenem. Imipenem (1.0 g every 8 h) and metronidazole (0.5 g every 8 h) were given, and mechanical ventilation and CVVH continued.\nAt day 12, the patient complained left back pain, which improved the next day without treatment. Platelet count (243 \u00d7 109/L) was normal, but both aPTT (67.5 s) and PT (17.3 s) were prolonged; his thromboelastogram (heparin cup) was normal. No cutaneous and mucosal bleeding was observed. The patient had no hemoptysis and his fecal occult blood test was negative. Abdominal CT scan at day 16 revealed left iliopsoas swelling, about 61.7 mm \u00d7 64.1 mm, with inhomogeneous densities, and occasional hyperintense opacities and an indistinct border (). A diagnosis of iliopsoas hematoma was made. Anticoagulation therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin was discontinued and switched to ex vivo anticoagulation with citrate.

He developed dyspnea unrelated to exertion and a cough associated with daily mucopurulent, occasionally blood-streaked, foul-smelling sputum. He was fatigued most days and nights, and a low-grade fever had been present intermittently, but he reported no weight loss, wheezing or pleuritic chest pain. In retrospect, he was diagnosed with pulmonary TB in February, 2004 on the basis of sputum smear microscopy for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and history of contact with a patient of active TB, received appropriate antitubercular therapy (ATT) for it; Tab Myrin-P Forte 4\u00d7once daily (OD) for two months, followed by Tab Myrin 4\u00d7OD for four months and Tab Vita-6 1\u00d7OD for six months; and recovered thereafter. Following that, his temperature was never over 99 F. Sputum was positive until July, 2004, and was said to have been negative after that time.

The lungs were dull to percussion, a few rhonchi over the right lung and diffuse, bilateral crackles were heard on auscultation. The infection protocol was implemented, including intravenous crystalloids, empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics, and chest physiotherapy.

Parathyroid hormone level was 146.9 pg/mL (normal: 10-65 pg/mL). Urinalysis showed protein (++), hyaline casts, and 24-hour urine protein raised at 3.7 g/day. Serum immunoglobulin levels were normal thus ruling out common variable immunodeficiency as a cause of secondary amyloidosis. Table gives an overview of the investigations. He was started on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and a one-off dialysis session after nephrology consultation.\nA single sputum smear was negative for AFB. A high-resolution computed tomography scan done about four months prior was consistent with bronchiectasis in the right lung, with no evidence of active TB (Figures , ).\nUltrasonography of the kidneys revealed bilaterally enlarged, echogenic kidneys with poor corticomedullary differentiation suggesting chronic kidney disease (Figure ).\nSuspecting amyloidosis, a biopsy was in order. The biopsy came directly from the kidneys, revealing renal amyloidosis (Figure ).\nSoon the symptoms became worse. By the third inpatient day, he ran a daily fever, continued to have a productive cough, raising from one-quarter to one cupful of sputum a day, and became hypoxic to the extent of utilizing 3 L per minute oxygen by nasal cannula.

He had been diagnosed with disc herniation at L4-L5, and had been hospitalized for bed-rest and treatment. While hospitalized, he had received several intravenous injections of sodium salicylate, but no peripheral intravenous catheter had been inserted. About 2 months after discharge, he had been referred to our outpatient anesthesiology department because of ongoing leg pain. Two weeks before presentation, he had received his first epidural block using 6 ml of 0.8% mepivacaine hydrochloride at the L4-L5 level, injected via the paramedian approach. Two days before presentation, a second epidural block using 5 ml of 0.8% mepivacaine hydrochloride had been administered at the same level. The skin had been disinfected with 5% chlorhexidine solution prior to needle insertion on both occasions. His medical history included hypertension and diabetes, for which he was taking antihypertensive and hypoglycemic agents, respectively. He had no history of trauma, shoulder injection, subclavian vein catheterization, or intravenous drug abuse. He did not have any focal dental infection or signs of tooth decay. He was unable to walk, due to increased leg pain. The day prior to admission, he experienced a fever of 39 \u00b0C.\nOn examination, he was in moderate respiratory distress and mildly diaphoretic, with a blood pressure of 97/51 mmHg, pulse rate of 95 beats/min, respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min, temperature of 39.5 \u00b0C, and oxygen saturation of 80% on room air. His oxygen saturation improved to 92% with oxygen administration (2 l/min by nasal cannula). Examination of the oral cavity and pharynx was normal, and there was no cervical lymphadenopathy. Chest examination was unremarkable except for swelling and severe tenderness over the left SCJ. Lumbar spine examination showed stiffness, with tenderness over the vertebrae. Movement of the lower back and pressure over the lumbar spine caused pain. The straight leg raising test and femoral nerve stretch test were inconclusive bilaterally because of lower back muscle spasm. His lower limb muscle power, knee and ankle reflexes, and sensation were normal. Bladder and bowel function were normal.\nLaboratory testing showed the following results: plasma white blood cell count (WBC) 18,490/mm3, platelet count 541,000/mm3, hemoglobin 9.0 g/dl, C-reactive protein 22.9 mg/dl, fasting blood glucose 335 mg/dl, glycosylated hemoglobin 8.1%, blood urea nitrogen 23.7 mg/dl, creatinine 0.73 mg/dl, glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 59 IU/l, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase 62 IU/l, cholinesterase 134 IU/l, alkaline phosphatase 600 IU/l, lactate dehydrogenase 381 IU/l, and creatine kinase 566 IU/l. US examination of the left SCJ suggested pyogenic arthritis with involvement of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The chest X-ray was normal, and there were no abnormalities on ECG or cardiac US. CT showed erosion and abscess formation of the SCJ with extension of the abscess into the mediastinum (Figures A and B) and sternocleidomastoid muscle (Figure C). Abdominal CT showed swelling of the left paraspinal muscle at L1-L3 (Figure A). MRI showed spondylitis of the L3-L4 vertebrae (Figure B) with a focal epidural collection and L3-L4 discitis (Figure C).\nAspiration of the SCJ revealed a turbid fluid (approximately 3 ml) (Figure ) with clusters of gram-positive cocci on microscopy. The SCJ was incised and drained, and the abscess cavity was enlarged to include the abscess of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle. Sulbactam/ampicillin administration was started immediately.

Initially, the pain was 7/10 in intensity but it improved spontaneously even before he reached the hospital or received any medications. On further probing, he reported that he had experienced intermittent episodes of chest pain for the last 3 weeks but it was mostly exertional and was relieved with rest. The pain was not associated with shortness of breath, diaphoresis, or nausea/vomiting. He denied any fever, chills, cough, abdominal pain, urinary or bowel complaints. He did not have any family history of significant cardiac events.\nOn presentation, the patient was hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 139/85 mmHg and heart rate of 81 beats per minute.

Fractional flow reserve\u2013computed tomography (FFR-CT) revealed a high likelihood of flow-limiting stenosis with a value of less than 0.5 secondary to the significant stenosis at the origin of the LAD and a low likelihood of flow-limiting stenosis in the left circumflex, ramus intermedius, and right coronary arteries.\nThe patient was then taken for cardiac catheterization which showed a 95% stenotic lesion of LAD with partial perfusion (TIMI grade 2 flow) giving rise to diagonal 1, which has an ostial and proximal 70% stenosis; ramus intermedius with proximal 70% segmental stenosis; circumflex, nondominant vessel, which has mild disease in proximal distal segments, giving rise to obtuse marginal 1, which has proximal 70% stenosis. Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted and the patient underwent bypass graft surgery.\nThe patient did well after the surgery. He stayed in the hospital for 4 days post-op without any complaints and was discharged home in stable condition. A referral to home care was made to provide for monitoring of the patient's progress and detection of any complications during the immediate post-op period.

We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 235.0 mg. To convert 235.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 235.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.235 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.235 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.000608 mol total cholestrol. To convert 0.000608 mol of total cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000608 mol total cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.608 mmol total cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L.

His last known normal neurological status was 1 h prior to arrival to the hospital. He had also been experiencing cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea and abdominal pains for about 3 weeks. He had gone to a different emergency room 1 week ago and was diagnosed with an upper respiratory tract infection and was advised over the counter cough medicine after obtaining a chest X-ray that was normal. His past medical history included possible hypertension for which he was on medication at one point, but currently off medication. He is a non-smoker. His blood pressure was 131/86 mm Hg, heart rate was 120 beats per minute, temperature was 36.4 \u00b0C, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and pulse oxygenation was 99% on room air. His neurological examination was consistent with expressive aphasia with right sided facial weakness. His sensation and motor function was intact in all four extremities with no ataxia. His other physical examination was unremarkable. His lab work () including complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel were normal except for a creatinine of 1.58 mg/dL (normal: 0.61 - 1.24 mg/dL). His international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.18 (normal: 0.88 - 1.15), partial thromboplastin time (PTT) was 27 s (normal: 26 - 39 s), D-dimer was 1,221 ng/mL (normal: < 500 ng/mL). His hemoglobin A1c was 5.8% (normal: < 5.7%), total cholesterol was 191 mg/dL (normal: < 200 mg/dL), triglycerides were 242 mg/dL (normal: 0 - 150 mg/dL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) was 25 mg/dL (normal: 39 - 79 mg/dL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was 107 mg/dL (normal: < 100 mg/dL).\nIn the emergency room, he received 325 mg of aspirin, and was assessed by a code stroke team. He was not recommended tissue plasminogen activator (tpA) by the tele-neurologist as he had inconsistent symptoms. His chest X-ray was normal, carotid ultrasound showed no stenosis, and computed tomography of the head showed subtle area of diminished attenuation in the right cerebellar hemisphere and left frontoparietal lobe for which a subtle area of infarction could not be excluded. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain completed the following day revealed acute to subacute infarcts in the right cerebellum and left and right frontoparietal cortical regions. He was started on aspirin 81 mg daily and atorvastatin 40 mg daily.\nHe was also tested for COVID-19 and his test result came back with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. He was started on azithromycin, zinc, and vitamin C. He had an echocardiogram of the heart which revealed an ejection fraction of 26-30% (normal: 55-60%) with abnormal left ventricular diastolic function, mildly increased left ventricular wall thickness, mild mitral regurgitation, and moderate global hypokinesis. A cardiologist evaluated him and deemed that he needed to have a transesophageal echocardiogram and left heart catheterization to determine the etiology of the newly diagnosed cardiomyopathy once he is recovered from his acute ischemic event and COVID-19.\nOn hospital day 4, he was found to have new global aphasia and left upper extremity weakness. He received a stat computed tomography of the brain (), which revealed a new right middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction involving the right frontoparietal lobe and insular cortex. At that point, he was loaded with 600 mg of clopidogrel and transferred to the neuro-intensive care unit. It was decided that since he failed antiplatelet therapy, that the antiplatelet medications aspirin and clopidogrel would be stopped and full-dose anticoagulation was commenced with enoxaparin.\nHe had hypercoagulability testing done, including antithrombin III, homocysteine, antinuclear antibody, beta-2-glycoprotein, cryoglobulin, and functional protein C, all of which were negative. He did have further testing of lupus anticoagulant which was positive; however, this test was not reliable as he had it done after being started on anticoagulation, which invalidates the reliability of the result.\nFor his cardiomyopathy, he was placed on a beta-blocker, angiotensin receptor blocker, and a diuretic. He had workup done for non-ischemic cardiomyopathy including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), thyroid function tests, hepatitis serologies, and ferritin levels which were all within normal limits except for slightly elevated ferritin of 523 ng/mL (normal: 24 - 336 ng/mL), which was not high enough to cause cardiomyopathy. He remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout the hospital stay. He was advised to have repeat echocardiogram done on an outpatient basis along with ischemic workup including left heart catheterization.\nHe recovered from the symptoms of COVID-19 including shortness of breath and cough and on the day of discharge, he was saturating 98% on room air and was stable from a pulmonary standpoint.\nHis hospital course was further complicated by dysphagia requiring a gastric feeding tube, healthcare-associated pneumonia, and staphylococcus bacteremia requiring prolonged antibiotics. He was discharged on the novel oral anticoagulant apixaban and advised repeat hypercoagulability testing in 3 months.

By the age of 36, he recalls knowing that he had \u201cundeniable, serious illness,\u201d and by the age of 38, he weighed over 400 pounds and suffered from severe sleep apnea, asthma and trouble breathing, eczema, allergies, hypertension (SBP/DBP = 255/155 on 2 medications), high total cholesterol (300 mg/dL), high triglycerides (279 mg/dL), and chronic shoulder and joint pain. He had difficulty moving and completing basic activities of daily living, such as putting on his shoes. He was on a number of medications that cost him approximately USD 7680 out of pocket, annually, while his insurance company paid a total of USD 19,646 for medications in 2009 alone. In addition to seeing a physician at least once every 1\u20132 weeks for his various conditions, he attended monthly appointments to aspirate fluid from his knees, had multiple visits to the ER, underwent shoulder surgery, and had one ankle reconstruction surgery with a second one imminent. Around 2012, at the age of 38, he decided to pursue gastric bypass surgery; however, his physician did not clear him to undergo the procedure, due to his poor underlying health. This event, combined with the recent deaths of two close family members, is what ultimately prompted him to begin considering lifestyle changes to improve his health. Initially, his approach to change was \u201cgoing one step further than the day before.\u201d First, he forced himself to simply get up from his chair once, and then twice per day, and then he progressed to being able to go on walks and walk up the stairs. He began researching additional lifestyle changes and watched documentaries, such as Forks Over Knives, which he describes as providing an entirely new perspective on food. He adopted dietary changes that began with a green juice fast followed by calorie restrictions, reducing red meat, and changing from full to lower fat dairy. On 1 January 2013, he adopted a strict, whole-food, plant-based (WFPB) dietary pattern. Thus, what started initially as a set of small lifestyle changes ultimately fostered a completely new lifestyle approach\u2014one where fitness and plant-based eating were the focus. Approximately 6 months into the lifestyle change, Case 1 had lost 150\u2013200 pounds, and although he does not recall his exact numbers, his cholesterol was cut in half, and triglyceride levels were in the normal range. By 2015, his cholesterol was 112 mg/dL and triglycerides were 74 mg/dL. In just 3\u20134 years, he went from barely standing up from a chair to running his first marathon in May 2016; by 2017, he was completing Ironman competitions and later ran an ultra-marathon. His current laboratory values as of 20 May 2021 include a total cholesterol of 103 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 36 mg/dL, triglycerides 61 mg/dL, non-HDL cholesterol 67 mg/dL, and blood pressure 122/78. Post lifestyle change, he also notes significant improvement in his level of happiness and quality of life, specifically with respect to being able to enjoy time with his family, traveling, and gaining a new outlook on life.\nAside from the possibility of gastric bypass surgery (USD 18,000\u201335,000) [], Case 1 was a candidate for a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machine for obstructive sleep apnea (USD 1000\u20133000) [] and a Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator (TENS) machine for pain management (approximately USD 100\u2013500) [] prior to his lifestyle change, highlighting an approximate average savings of USD 28,800 in discreet medical costs potentially avoided. Post lifestyle change, he reports spending only USD 61 per year on medications (B12 injections), as opposed to his previous approximated average spending of USD 7600+ in annual medication costs. Pharmaceutical costs covered by his insurance company decreased from USD 19,000+ in 2009 to USD 122.24 in 2015 and 2016 combined.

Anti-cardiolipin immunoglobulin G, anti-cardiolipin immunoglobulin M, and lupus anticoagulant were all negative. Urinalysis revealed 3+ proteinuria (spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio was 10.9 g/g creatinine; spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio was 7,406.2 mg/g creatinine) and trace hematuria (1-3 red blood cells/high-power field). To investigate the etiology of nephrotic syndrome, an urgent renal biopsy was performed.\nThereafter, although she had no risk factors for thrombosis such as immobilization, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, morbid obesity, or a recent orthopedic or gynecologic surgery, to rule out arterial thrombosis of the right lower extremity, lower extremity computed tomography (CT) angiography was performed. The CT imaging revealed that the right superficial femoral artery was occluded and there was no identifiable proximal source of thromboembolism in other large arteries (). On the basis of these CT angiographic findings, right lower extremity angiography was performed, which revealed a total occlusion of the right superficial femoral artery (). For the treatment of this condition, balloon dilatation was initially tried at the distal superficial femoral artery but failed. Hence, thrombectomy was performed with the Fogarty balloon catheter and the thrombi were successfully aspirated. After the interventional treatment, a good distal arterial flow was reestablished (). Thereafter, warfarin (5 mg/day) as an anticoagulant and corticosteroid treatments were initiated.\nSubsequent transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiographic studies showed no evidence of intracardiac thrombus, vegetation, or other structural abnormalities including patent foramen ovale. Quantitation of proteinuria was confirmed by using a 24-hour urine collection that showed 10.2 g/day of protein excretion and 7.8 g/day of albumin excretion, respectively. Afterwards, with administration of warfarin and corticosteroid, the patient had nearly completely recovered from the edema and claudication and was discharged. The renal pathologic results were consistent with minimal change disease ( and ). Two months after discharge, her urine protein-to-creatinine ratio decreased to less than 0.1 g/g creatinine, her serum albumin level was maintained at 4.1 g/dl, and she had no further symptoms or signs of arterial thrombosis.", "Question": "What is the patient's Framingham Risk Score?", "LLM Answer": "name 'N' is not defined", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "0", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient's gender is Female.\nFor females, the formula for computing the framingham risk score is 31.764001 * ln(age) + 22.465206 * ln(total_cholestrol) - 1.187731 * ln(hdl_cholestrol) + 2.552905 * ln(sys_bp) + 0.420251 * bp_medicine + 13.07543 * smoker + -5.060998 * ln(age) * ln(total_cholestrol) + -2.996945 * ln(age_smoke) * smoker - 146.5933061, where 'bp_medicine' is a binary variable for whether a patient's blood pressure is being treated with medicine, total cholestrol and hdl cholestrol are in mg/dL, and 'smoker' is whether the patient is a smoker or not.\nFrom this, we use the risk score to get likelihood for a patient getting myocardial infraction (MI) or dying in the next 10 years: 1 - 0.9402^exp(risk_score), where risk_score is the value from the formula above.\nThe patient is 39 years old. The patient is not a smoker, making the smoking variable equal to 0.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 120.0 mm Hg.\nThe note does not specify whether the patient takes medicine for treating blood pressure and so we assume this to be false, making the bp_medicine variable equal to 0.\nThe concentration of total cholestrol is 349.4 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 349.4 mg.

To convert 50.0 mg of hdl cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 50.0 mg hdl cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.05 g hdl cholestrol. To convert from grams of hdl cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.05 g/(386.65 g hdl cholestrol/mol) = 0.000129 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.000129 mol of hdl cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000129 mol hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.129 mmol hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.129 mmol hdl cholestrol/0.1 L = 1.29 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 50.0 mg hdl cholestrol/dL converts to 1.29 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. \nPlugging in these values will give us the risk score: 31.764001 * ln(67) + 22.465206 * ln(5.07) - 1.187731 * ln(1.29) + 2.552905 * ln(140.0) + 0.420251 * 1 + 13.07543 * 0 + -5.060998 * ln(67) * ln(5.07) + -2.996945 * ln(67) * 0 - 146.5933061 = 1.6.\nPlugging this into the MI risk formula gives us 1 - 0.98767^exp(1.6) = 0.1 %.\nThe patient's percentage of getting MI or dying is 0.1 %.", "Result": "Incorrect"}

On physical examination, the heart rate was 85 beats/min and the blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg. The abdomen was soft, with normal bowel sounds and with no organomegaly. No peripheral edema was seen. No rash, petechiae, ecchymoses, oral lesions, or lymphadenopathy was found. The arms revealed no abnormalities and the legs were normal. Neurological examination was normal.\nThe levels of glucose, urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium were normal; also the levels of total bilirubin, aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase were normal. Lipid panel showed total cholesterol (TC) 144 mg/dl, triglycerides (TG) 79 mg /dl, HDL-C 5 mg/dl, and low density lipoprotein (LDL) 123 mg/dl. Lipid panel done three years ago showed a HDL-C of 41 mg/dl. Further workup revealed serum apolipoprotein A1 (APO A1) 97 mg/dl (94-176), apolipoprotein B (APO B) 35 mg/dl (52-109), the ratio of APO B/ APO A 1 0.36 , lipoprotein A 19.0 nmol/l (<75), and direct LDL 28 mg/dl ( <130). Important laboratory investigations are given in Table .\nThe patient was treated with an incremental dose of extended-release nicotinic acid but his HDL remained low. The secondary causes of low HDL-C levels such as the use of androgens, progestins, cigarette smoking, obesity, low-fat diet, and drugs like beta-blockers were ruled out. This leads us to consider the less well-known but well-documented fact that monoclonal gammopathies have unusual specificity for apolipoprotein, and paraproteins may interfere with the measurement of HDL-C in some automated analyzers. To confirm our hypothesis we performed serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation, which showed IgG 720 mg/dl (576-1782), IgA 116 mg/dl ( 59-484) and an abnormally high IgM at 3510 mg/dl (57-266).

He also complained of cold intolerance and sluggish speech and movement that started a few weeks earlier, as well as 2-kg weight gain over the past year. He started rosuvastatin (5 mg, once daily) a year ago, with no dose adjustment; the patient was diagnosed with hypothyroidism at the same time. He was recommended levothyroxine treatment but did not initiate treatment because he had no related symptoms or discomfort in his daily life.\nGeneral physical examination revealed dry skin, neck vein distension, nontender diffuse goiter around the neck, and myxedema with puffy face, bilateral periorbital and lower extremities edema. His pulse rate was 52 beats/minute, blood pressure was 114/82 mmHg, respiratory rate was 20 breaths/minute, and his body temperature was 37.1 \u00b0C. Muffled heart sounds without fine crackle were also detected.\nThe initial results of laboratory tests (Table ) were as follows: BUN 19.0 (7\u201323) mg/dL, creatinine 1.5 (0.7\u20131.4) mg/dL, creatine kinase 9300 (43\u2013198) IU/L, lactate dehydrogenase 1876 (238\u2013422) IU/L, myoglobulin 636 (28\u201372) ng/mL, alanine aminotransferase 357 (3\u201345) IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase 278 (3\u201345) IU/L, creatine kinase muscle-brain fraction (CK-MB) 52.07 (0\u20134.87) U/L, troponin I 0.057 (0\u20130.014) ng/mL, total cholesterol 222 (130\u2013240) mg/dL, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) 136 (50\u2013160) mg/dL, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) 74 (40\u201385) mg/dL, and triglycerides 127 (35\u2013200) mg/dL.

The pain was: retrosternal; of sudden onset, starting 2 hours prior to presentation at our hospital; continuous and worsening in severity; described as pressure; irradiating to the neck and left upper extremity; had no precipitating or alleviating factors; and was associated with nausea, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath. She denied headache, dizziness, syncope, palpitations, or vomiting. Prior to the pain beginning, the patient denied having any of the symptoms. Review of her system was negative except for the symptoms mentioned.\nThe patient had no significant medical history except that she was seen many years prior for mild thrombocytosis during her pregnancy. At that time, she was started on aspirin. She did not keep her follow-up appointments afterward. Her surgical history was significant for hysterectomy.\nHer father had had coronary artery disease and MI at the age of 50; he died at the age of 67. Her mother had been diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia and succumbed to blastic crisis after 7 years. Three of the patient\u2019s four children were positive for Factor V Leiden and one daughter developed extensive deep-vein thrombosis after 4 weeks on the oral contraceptive pills and major bleeding on warfarin (severe hemorrhagic ovarian cysts).\nThe patient was a nonsmoker and denied any alcohol or drug use. She had no history of allergy. Her only medication was baby aspirin once daily.\nOn initial examination, the patient was awake, alert, and oriented. Her blood pressure was 90/60 \u03bcg, and she had a pulse of 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and a temperature of 99\u00b0F. There was no jugular vein distention. Auscultation was clear throughout both lungs. Cardiac auscultation revealed an S4 gallop. No loud murmurs were appreciated. Abdominal exam was unremarkable, with no hepatosplenomegaly. There was no edema of the lower extremities. There was positive erythromelalgia of the hands.\nHer electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm and ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads from V1 to V6 consistent with a large anterior wall infarct ().\nInitial blood work showed negative cardiac enzymes. Her hemoglobin was 13.7 g/dL, white blood cell count was 14.2 th/mm3, and platelet count was 935,000 th/mm3. The patient\u2019s basic metabolic profile was normal. Her low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein were 148 mg/dL and 61 mg/dL, respectively.\nThe patient was transferred urgently to the catheterization lab. Left heart catheterization showed a total proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) occlusion (), while her other coronary arteries were normal. A successful balloon angioplasty, with two bare metal stents, was performed on the 100% lesion in the proximal LAD, and an excellent result was attained (). The patient was started, in addition to aspirin (325 mg daily), on clopidogrel, a statin, and beta-blockers. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35% with severe hypokinesia of the mid-apical anteroseptal and apical walls.\nDuring her hospital stay, the patient was seen by the hematology-oncology team. Further workup was done and this showed a positive JAK-2 mutation. She was negative for the Factor V Leiden mutation (R506Q) and BCR-ABL genes translocation (Philadelphia chromosome). The rest of her blood work was within normal limits, including the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (1 mm/h), ferritin (151 ng/mL), thyroid-stimulating hormone (1.3 mIU/mL), folate (10.2 ng/mL), vitamin B12 (382 pg/mL) and bleeding time (1.1 min). Patient was diagnosed with ET and started on hydroxyurea 1,000 mg twice daily. Patient was discharged in a stable condition with the plan to follow up with the cardiologist and hematologist.\nTwo weeks later, during a follow-up at the hematology office, her complete blood count revealed a platelet count of 803 th/mm3, so the dose of hydroxyurea was increased to 2,500 mg twice daily. Subsequent follow-up a few weeks later indicated a platelet count of 310 th/mm3, so the patient was kept on the same dose for the next 3 years. Her platelet count four months ago was still within the normal range.\nThe patient has been followed-up in the outpatient cardiology office for the last 3 years. Within a few months, her left ventricular function was found to have improved to normal and has been normal since then.

In addition, she had had Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis for about 10 years. She denied a history of smoking or drinking. She was taking valsartan (320 mg/day), hydrochlorothiazide (75 mg/day), methyldopa (1,500 mg/day), atenolol (100 mg/day), spironolactone (25 mg/day), and levothyroxine sodium (300 \u00b5g/day) at initial consultation. She was intolerant to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors because of cough and amlodipine due to lower-limb edema. The patient told us that she was taking all the medications correctly. The degree of adherence was determined using the eight-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS8) translated into Brazilian Portuguese, and the patient was considered to have high adherence (eight points) on this test.\nHer physical examination revealed BP 230/160 mmHg (mean of three measures) in both arms, heart rate 80 bpm, body mass index 29.3 kg/m2, and waist circumference 94 cm. The BP measure in the lower limbs did not show a significant difference in relation to upper limbs. She had no abnormalities of the heart, lungs, or abdomen. According to initial complementary exams, the patient presented fasting glycemia 101 mg/dL, sodium 142 mEq/L, potassium 4.4 mEq/L, creatinine 0.8 mg/dL, estimated glomerular filtration rate (CKD-EPI) 89.3 mL/min/1.73 m2, normal routine urine, microalbuminuria 230 mg/24 h (normal <30 mg/24 h), total cholesterol 148 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol 86 mg/dL, and triglycerides 122 mg/dL. The 24-hour urinary sodium measure was 164 mEq/L (ideal level <100 mEq/L). Other exam results were thyroid-stimulating hormone 40.89 mU/L, free T4 0.75 ng/dL, parathyroid hormone 58.86 pg/mL (normal 10\u201365 pg/mL), vitamin D 30.8 ng/mL, and serum calcium 9.2 mg/dL (normal 8\u201310 mg/dL).\nElectrocardiography was normal, with sinus rhythm and heart rate of 74 bpm. Echocardiography showed structural and functional normality. Ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) revealed 24-hour mean BP of 204/130 mmHg, awake BP of 207/133 mmHg, and 193/122 mmHg BP during sleep, with attenuated nocturnal dipping in systolic and diastolic BP. The patient had hypertensive retinopathy (grade 2 Keith\u2013Wagener\u2013Barker classification). All investigations for secondary hypertension were negative. Therefore, primary hyperaldosteronism, renovascular hypertension, renal disease, obstructive sleep apnea, pheochromocytoma, acromegaly, and Cushing\u2019s disease were excluded, as shown in . Four weeks prior to investigation for hyperaldosteronism, her thiazide diuretic, renin\u2013angiotensin system blocker, and mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonist were stopped for screening this condition, in accordance with guidelines.\nDuring outpatient follow-up, hydrochlorothiazide was exchanged for chlorthalidone (25 mg/day), and nitrendipine (20 mg/day) was added to her antihypertensive treatment. Nevertheless, the patient had several BP elevations of up to 290/180 mmHg and a hospital admission with hypertensive encephalopathy, even with the use of valsartan (320 mg/day), chlortalidone (25 mg/day), nitrendipine (20 mg/day), methyldopa (1,500 mg/day), atenolol (100 mg/day), and spironolactone (150 mg/day). Moreover, she was also using diazepam (10 mg/day) and levothyroxine sodium (300 \u00b5g/day). On hospital discharge, methyldopa was exchanged for clonidine (600 \u00b5g/day), and hydralazine (150 mg/day) was added to the therapy regimen.\nA careful interview and investigation of nonadherence was performed, and given that the patient stated that she had taken all the prescribed medications, a hypothesis of intestinal absorption disturbance was arrived at as the cause of the lack of control of hypertension and thyroid function. However, all functional, anatomic, and histopathologic investigation for malabsorption syndromes gave negative results (upper digestive endoscopy and colonoscopy, both with normal biopsies, antitissue transglutaminase IgA and IgG antibodies and antigliadin IgA antibodies were nonreagents upon testing for celiac disease).\nConsidering the difficulty in controlling the hypertension and due to the high cardiovascular risk presented by the patient (target-organ damage), the team opted to hospitalize her for the purpose of observing her evolution and performing other investigations. The usual biochemical tests were normal. She maintained her previous weight. During the hospitalization, there was a progressive control of BP levels around the fifth day of admission with administration of the same drugs previously used by the patient (valsartan 320 mg/day, chlortalidone 25 mg/day, nitrendipine 20 mg/day, atenolol 100 mg/day, clonidine (600 \u00b5g/day, hydralazine (150 mg/day, and spironolactone 150 mg/day); ).

The patient was thus referred to our department for suspected iNPH related to the gait disturbance.\nHer height of 148.3 cm, weight of 54.4 kg, and body mass index of 24.8 were all within standard ranges. There was no medical history that could have led to secondary hydrocephalus. There were no abnormalities in vital signs with body temperature 36 \u00b0C, blood pressure 110/63 mm/Hg, and heart rate 83 beats per minute. Although the patient\u2019s consciousness was clear, 15 on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), and there was no muscle weakness, she walked with her legs apart in short quick steps, and required a walking aid. While muscle tonus was normal, the patient complained of mild pain when extending the knee. As to higher order brain functions, mini mental state examination (MMSE) results were 24/30, and the frontal assessment battery (FAB) results were 9/18. Blood test findings at the time of admission were within normal range apart from mild hypoalbuminemia (total protein 4.6 g/dL, albumin 2.7 g/dL, total cholesterol 147 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 100 mg/dL), and elevated thyroid free T3 (TSH 4.333 \u03bcIU/mL, free T3 3.78 pg/mL, free T4 1.16 ng/dL). There were no blood-sugar or electrolyte (Na 140 mmol/L, Cl 106 mmol/, K 4.1 mmol/L, serum glucose 73 mg/dL) abnormalities. Head MRI revealed enlargement of all cerebral ventricles, with an Evan\u2019s index of 0.4, and the Sylvian fissure appeared wide open consistent with iNPH. However, the specific feature of narrowing of the sulci at the high convexity area was not obvious (Fig. ). Single-photon emission computed tomography revealed reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) surrounding the Sylvian fissure, with relatively increased CBF in the convexity, which was consistent with the pattern for iNPH (Fig. ). Findings for the sulci at the high convexity area were inconsistent with typical iNPH, however, and we thus reconsidered the possibility of other diseases that may have caused the gait disturbance.\nDetailed tests were ultimately performed after hospital admission including a spinal tap. Following admission, the patient gradually became less active, and tended to stay in bed. Re-examination revealed blood sugar levels of 40 mg/dL and systolic blood pressure of 90 mm/Hg. On suspicion of impaired anterior pituitary function, scans were performed of the pituitary in the diencephalon, and baseline pituitary hormone levels were verified. The spinal tap results were negative. On MRI, pituitary gland was normal measuring 12 mm in maximum diameter with no enlargement or deviation of stalk, and there were no neoplastic lesions, inflammatory lesions in the pituitary area of the diencephalon, or changes suggesting that surgery had been performed in all sequences including contrast-enhanced dynamic images (Fig. ). Table presents baseline hormone levels, and Table the results of the anterior pituitary gland hormone loading test using corticotrophin releasing hormone, thyrotropin releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone releasing hormone, and growth hormone releasing hormone. Pituitary hormone results included ACTH <1.0 pg/ml (normal range: 7.2\u201363.3), and cortisol levels <1.0 \u03bc/dL (normal range: 4.0\u201318.3), indicating pituitary adrenal insufficiency. There were no decreases in other hormone levels, with relatively mild elevations of growth hormone, prolactin and free T3 levels. We checked carefully again the medical history of the patient, but there were no recent history of exogenous glucocorticoid treatment. An additional pituitary stimulation test was performed, in which ACTH and cortisol responses only were found to have disappeared, and isolated ACTH deficiency was thus diagnosed (Fig. ). After initiation of hydrocortisone supplements, her gait quickly improved. While observing the clinical symptoms, hydrocortisone (Cortril \u00ae) was adjusted to a daily dose of 15 mg, and after instructing the patient as to how to respond on sick days, she was discharged to return home. At approximately 6 months after discharge, although the ventricular enlargement on MRI was same as before, the patient scored 27/30 points on the MMSE and 15/18 points on the FAB.", "Question": "What is the patient's Framingham Risk Score?", "LLM Answer": "name 'N' is not defined", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "0", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient's gender is Female.\nFor females, the formula for computing the framingham risk score is 31.764001 * ln(age) + 22.465206 * ln(total_cholestrol) - 1.187731 * ln(hdl_cholestrol) + 2.552905 * ln(sys_bp) + 0.420251 * bp_medicine + 13.07543 * smoker + -5.060998 * ln(age) * ln(total_cholestrol) + -2.996945 * ln(age_smoke) * smoker - 146.5933061, where 'bp_medicine' is a binary variable for whether a patient's blood pressure is being treated with medicine, total cholestrol and hdl cholestrol are in mg/dL, and 'smoker' is whether the patient is a smoker or not.\nFrom this, we use the risk score to get likelihood for a patient getting myocardial infraction (MI) or dying in the next 10 years: 1 - 0.9402^exp(risk_score), where risk_score is the value from the formula above.\nThe patient is 65 years old. The note does not specify whether the patient is a smoker and so we assume this to be false, making the smoking variable equal to 0.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 90.0 mm Hg.\nThe patient has been specified to not take medication for treating their blood pressure, making the bp_medicine variable equal to 0.\nThe concentration of total cholestrol is 147.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 147.0 mg. To convert 147.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 147.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.147 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.147 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.00038 mol total cholestrol. To convert 0.00038 mol of total cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.00038 mol total cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.38 mmol total cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.38 mmol total cholestrol/0.1 L = 3.8 mmol total cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 147.0 mg total cholestrol/dL converts to 3.8 mmol total cholestrol/L. \nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 100.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 100.0 mg. To convert 100.0 mg of hdl cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 100.0 mg hdl cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.1 g hdl cholestrol. To convert from grams of hdl cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.1 g/(386.65 g hdl cholestrol/mol) = 0.000259 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.000259 mol of hdl cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000259 mol hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.259 mmol hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.259 mmol hdl cholestrol/0.1 L = 2.59 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 100.0 mg hdl cholestrol/dL converts to 2.59 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. \nPlugging in these values will give us the risk score: 31.764001 * ln(65) + 22.465206 * ln(3.8) - 1.187731 * ln(2.59) + 2.552905 * ln(90.0) + 0.420251 * 0 + 13.07543 * 0 + -5.060998 * ln(65) * ln(3.8) + -2.996945 * ln(65) * 0 - 146.5933061 = -1.9.\nPlugging this into the MI risk formula gives us 1 - 0.98767^exp(-1.9) = 0.0 %.\nThe patient's percentage of getting MI or dying is 0.0 %.", "Result": "Incorrect"}

His medical comorbidities included hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, asthma, seizure disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, and a history of pulmonary embolism. His only surgery was an inguinal hernia repair in the past. He reported an allergy to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. He denied alcohol consumption, smoking, or recreational drug use. He had not travelled outside the United States, nor did he encounter any sick contacts. He denied the use of any herbal preparations or over-the-counter medications. Coumadin was the only prescription medication he was taking on a regular basis.\nOn examination, the patient was a well-built man in respiratory distress. He was tachypneic and hypoxic, saturating at 88% (SpO2) on room air. Blood pressure was 130/80, heart rate 88 bpm, and he was afebrile at 97 \u00b0F. On inspection, no icterus, lymphadenopathy, or peripheral edema was noted. On auscultation, his lungs were clear bilaterally, and no heart murmurs were appreciated. His abdomen was soft, non-tender with no hepatosplenomegaly, and bowel sounds were normal.\nInitial troponin and pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels were elevated. A computerized tomography with contrast of the chest revealed multiple filling defects within the pulmonary arterial system, indicative of bilateral acute on chronic thromboembolic disease. The patient was started on enoxaparin 120 mg twice a day in addition to his coumadin, as an aim to bridge to a therapeutic international normalized ratio between 2 and 3.\nOn admission, his liver enzymes were within normal limits as per our institute laboratory values, with an alanine transaminase (ALT) of 28 units/L, aspartate transaminase (AST) of 13 units/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 95 units/L, albumin of 3.4 g/dL, total bilirubin of 0.4 mg/dL, and conjugated bilirubin of 0.1 mg/dL.

R ratio from these laboratory values was 5.56, consistent with hepatocellular pattern of liver injury.\nAn ultrasound and computerized tomography of the abdomen was negative for any significant pathology. Echocardiogram of the heart revealed a normal ejection fraction and normal diastolic function. Serologies for hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, Epstein Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus were all negative. Antinuclear antibody screen, anti-mitochondrial antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, and anti-liver kidney microsomal antibody were also negative.

On examination, he was febrile with 38 \u00b0C, in moderate respiratory distress, and had mild oxyhemoglobin desaturation (SpO2 of 94% on room air). Chest CT on admission revealed multiple ground-glass opacities and areas of pulmonary consolidation in all segments of the lungs (Figure ).\nBlood tests demonstrated an extra-high level of ferritin and noticeably increased CRP and aminotransferases (Table ).\nCOVID-19 was confirmed by a positive PCR test obtained via a nasopharyngeal swab. Because of a pronounced pulmonary involvement on CT and clinical data suggestive of CRS, the patient was started on methylprednisolone 125 mg IV daily, enoxaparin, lopinavir, ritonavir, umifenovir, and ceftriaxone. Despite treatment, during the first two hospital days, he experienced severe symptoms including transient elevations of body temperature to 38 \u00b0C with chills, cough, shortness of breath, dizziness, and insomnia. Blood oxygen saturation decreased to 85-90% on room air, requiring noninvasive low-flow oxygenation with growth in SpO2 to 90-92% on 5 L/min of oxygen via facial mask. The patient was fully conscious, complied with recommendations of the personnel, and was put to a prone-position for two hours every two hours.\nOn day three, he underwent a deterioration with severe dyspnea at rest, aggravation of fever (38.1 \u00b0C), and fall in SpO2 to 87% on low-flow oxygenation of 5 L/min via facial mask. The patient was transferred to the medical ICU where he was started on high-flow oxygenation of 40 L/min FiO2 50% via nasal cannula and given 400 mg tocilizumab IV. By the end of day three, the body temperature decreased in the patient to 37.1 \u00b0C. On high-flow oxygenation via nasal cannula, blood oxygen saturation fluctuated around 92% with rapid desaturation to 87% on room air; the respiratory rate was 22-24 breaths per minute. The patient was hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 130/70 mmHg and a heart rate of 94 beats per minute.\nOn day four, a threatening progression of respiratory insufficiency occurred. There was a registered a fall in SpO2 to 80% on high-flow oxygenation via nasal cannula; the patient became agitated, his respiratory rate increased to 42-44 per minute, blood pressure reached 175/94 mmHg, and heart rate increased to 135 per minute. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed a pH of 7.33, paO2 of 59 mmHg, and paCO2 of 35.7 mmHg. The patient was intubated and treated with low tidal volume ventilation. This led to the stabilizing of his clinical condition. Blood oxygen saturation increased to 98%, blood pressure decreased to 120/70 mmHg, and heart rate was 85 per minute. CT scan on day four demonstrated multiple ground-glass opacities and areas of consolidation in all segments of the lungs (Figure ). CT picture was suggestive of ARDS.\nConsidering the risk of the unfavorable future course of the disease, the patient was prescribed a pulse therapy with methylprednisolone. On hospital days four to six, he received methylprednisolone 1,000 mg/day IV, and his condition noticeably improved. On day six, sedation was discontinued, and the patient demonstrated SpO2 of 98% on spontaneous ventilation. He was fully conscious and responsive to non-verbal contact.\nOn day eight, the patient experienced transient deterioration with an elevation of body temperature to 40.1 \u00b0C, SpO2 fall to 94%, and septic shock requiring a norepinephrine drip. Chest CT on day nine showed a distinct positive change in CT picture compared to that of day four. The ground-glass opacities decreased in amount and density all over the lungs. However, new pulmonary tissue consolidation was found in the lower lobe of the right lung, suggestive of pneumonia (Figure ).\nBlood analysis on day nine revealed a pronounced neutrophil leukocytosis, mild normochromic anemia, further elevation of CRP, and a high level of procalcitonin. The patient was diagnosed with nosocomial pneumonia. After a seven-day course of meropenem and an infusion of IV immunoglobulin (20 g), his condition finally improved; he was weaned from the ventilator on day 14 and returned to the regular ward on day 16 with SpO2 of 99% on low-flow oxygen.\nThe patient was discharged home on day 23 with no symptoms, normal oxyhemoglobin saturation, and a negative nasopharyngeal swab test for SARS-CoV-2.

On EMS arrival, the patient appeared to be convulsing, which quickly resolved, and he was then nonverbal but remained interactive. He was noted to have left-sided hemiparesis and was expressively aphasic. The patient was not on anticoagulants and family denied any recent trauma, bleeding, or surgery.\nInitial physical examination revealed a nonverbal, elderly gentleman in mild distress. He was aphasic. Vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 98/62 millimeters of mercury (mmHg), pulse 76 beats per minute, respirations 19 breaths per minute, oral temperature 36 degree Celsius (\u00b0C) (96.8\u00b0F), and pulse oximetry 99% on room air. Neurologic examination was notable for pupils equally round and reactive to light, left visual field loss with right gaze preference, left facial droop, and localization of painful stimuli on the right with absence of painful withdrawal on the left upper and lower extremities.

As the patient was within the treatment window, tPA was administered one hour after symptom onset for his right middle cerebral artery syndrome acute ischemic stroke.\nOn re-examination 20 minutes after tPA administration, the patient was returning to his mental baseline with improving neurologic exam. He was noted to be awake, alert, and talking to his family. Approximately 45 minutes after tPA administration, the patient had an acute change in mental status, acute onset vomiting, and was noted to be hypotensive to 61/46 mmHg. Focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) exam using point-of-care ultrasound revealed a large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology, specifically right ventricular diastolic collapse (). He then lost pulses and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated. TXA was immediately given to inhibit tPA-induced fibrinolysis and bleeding.\nCompressions were halted and pericardiocentesis was performed with 200mL of dark blood removed using a triple lumen catheter (TLC) kit. An ultrasound-guided approach with Seldinger technique was used to insert the TLC into the pericardial space.

Cryoprecipitate was ordered but not immediately available. His blood pressure recovered to 179/117 mmHg. No epinephrine or other Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support medications were given during the period of cardiac arrest. Repeat point-of-care cardiac ultrasound showed resolution of tamponade physiology.\nCardiothoracic surgery was consulted, and they exchanged the TLC catheter for a pericardial drain over a wire in the ED. No additional blood was noted to drain from the new pericardial drain. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and was awaiting transport out of the ED. During this time his family was bedside, talking with the patient. Over the next hour, he was treated with 10 units of cryoprecipitate. Approximately 3.5 hours after arrival to the ED, the patient again became unresponsive and was noted to be hypotensive and bradycardic. Point-of-care ultrasound showed re-accumulation of pericardial effusion and worsening tamponade physiology.\nUnfortunately, the existing pericardial drain was not functioning even after flushing the catheter. The patient again lost pulses and CPR was initiated. A second pericardiocentesis was performed by cardiothoracic surgery with removal of 800 mL of bright red blood. Despite removing the blood, the tamponade was not resolving as the re-accumulation was too great.

Her vital signs were remarkable for a blood pressure of 122/91 mmHg, heart rate of 180 beats per minute with an irregular rate, a temperature of 36.4 \u00b0C, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 98% on 5 L nasal cannula. On examination, the patient appeared to be in mild distress. No jugular venous distention was appreciated. Her chest auscultation revealed bilateral crackles.\nThe patient's laboratory workup is summarized in Table . A nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was positive for COVID-19 and blood cultures showed no growth. Chest X-ray revealed patchy bilateral peripheral lung infiltrates (Figure ), and CT angiography of the chest showed no pulmonary embolism but revealed bilateral patchy ground-glass lung infiltrates consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia (Figure ). EKG showed a new atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response (Figure ). Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a new low left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction of 35-40%, with LV hypertrophy, as well as a granular appearance of LV myocardium suspicious for infiltrative cardiomyopathy (Figure ). Echocardiogram obtained one year prior had shown LV ejection fraction of 50-55% with LV hypertrophy.\nThe patient was started on intravenous (IV) diltiazem drip, but her heart rate was difficult to control; hence she was started on IV amiodarone and eventually converted to sinus rhythm. She was started on IV heparin for anticoagulation. Her respiratory status deteriorated, and she was subsequently intubated and mechanically ventilated. The COVID-19 pneumonia was treated with a combination of steroids, antibiotics, remdesivir, and convalescence plasma. She improved clinically and was discharged home on oral amiodarone, metoprolol succinate, and warfarin.\nCMR obtained about two months from the date of admission showed extensive myocarditis with a typical pattern of sub-epicardial and mid-wall delayed enhancement (Figure ). There was no edema to indicate the acuteness of the disease. LV systolic function was normal with an ejection fraction of 60-65%.

His functional capacity was higher than 4 metabolic equivalents and he had no previous experience of general anesthesia. Preoperative evaluation showed a normal electrocardiogram (ECG) and no specific lung lesion was found by chest radiography. There was no abnormal finding in a pulmonary function test or in conventional laboratory exams. Preoperative thallium single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) detected a perfusion defect on the inferior wall, and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a moderate degree of akinesia on the inferior wall. Both of these findings in thallium SPECT and TTE were detected for 8 years after the previous attack with no development of new ischemic lesions.\nWhen the patient arrived in the operation room, his blood pressure (BP; systolic/diastolic), heart rate, and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) were 166/94 mmHg, 76 beats/min, and 99% respectively. Preoxygenation with 80% oxygen was performed followed by intravenous administration of midazolam 2 mg and lidocaine 20 mg. Induction was started with a target controlled infusion (TCI; Asan Pump, version 2.0, BionetCo., Seoul, Korea) of propofol and remifentanil at 2 \u00b5g/ml and 3 ng/ml, respectively. Cisatracurium (12 mg) was administered and mask-valve ventilation was started after the patient lost his spontaneous breathing. During mask ventilation, a depression in ST segment of more than 3 mm was detected in ECG, and difficulty in manual ventilation was noted. Propofol and remifentanil infusion were immediately stopped, and the patient was promptly intubated followed by ventilation with 100% oxygen. A few minutes later, SpO2 rapidly decreased and his BP, initially 128/78 mmHg, dropped to 64/42 mmHg. Although vasoactive drugs including phenylephrine and epinephrine were administered, the BP continued to decrease to an undetectable level by a noninvasive BP cuff. Direct arterial pressure was monitored, and a central venous catheter was inserted to maintain fluid therapy and continuous drug administration. The patient quickly developed ventricular fibrillation and we thus initiated a sequential algorithm of cardiopulmonary cerebral resuscitation (CPCR). Immediate defibrillation (200J) followed by manual chest compression was performed with repeated intravenous administration of atropine (0.5 mg) and epinephrine (1 mg). A portable transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was obtained 20 minutes after CPCR was initiated, which showed global hypokinesia in the myocardial wall with akinesia in the inferior wall. However, the patient had not return of spontaneous circulation for 40 minutes, and the patient showed repeated ventricular fibrillation refractory to defibrillation. An emergent consultation of cardiac surgeons was requested to apply veno-arterial type extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to substitute cardiac function. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and remained intubated during the application of ECMO. In the ICU, sequential laboratory tests including cardiac enzymes were performed. Upon arrival in the ICU, the patient's serum troponin-I and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) levels were 6.292 ng/ml and 34.6 ng/ml respectively, and within 5 hours they were increased to 44.099 ng/ml and 107.3 ng/ml. After 8 hours of ICU admission, 12-lead ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with right bundle branch block. On the same day, the patient had return of drowsy consciousness level from comatose state. After showing improvement on serial ECG and the hemodynamic status of the patient, the ECMO circuit was successfully weaned on the following day. He was remain intubated and sedated for three more days to continue conventional therapies for recovery and discharged to the general ward on the day of extubation. Cardiac enzymes levels were normalized (troponin-I, 1.5 ng/ml;CK-MB, 3.7 ng/ml) 5 days after the incidence had occurred.\nOn suspicion of anaphylactic reaction as a cause of perioperative MI, serum tryptase level was measured and an intradermal skin test was performed to all anesthetic drugs that had been used during the induction period. The level of serum tryptase was detected on the day of the incidence occurred. Serum tryptase level was 28.6 \u00b5g/L, which was higher than normal value (13.5 \u00b5g/L). Three days after the incidence, an intradermal skin test was performed and a positive reaction was only seen in cisatracurium at a 1 : 100 dilution.

Vital signs were recorded as the following: blood pressure of 160/87 mmHg, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 40 beats per minute and SPo2 of 78%. A chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrates () and a nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected and tested positive for COVID-19 using molecular testing.\nThe patient was moved to the ICU with the diagnosis of Coronavirus-19 pneumonia. Clinical history was updated to include a previous diagnosis of diabetes and hypertension. Corticosteroid therapy with dexamethasone (12 mg/day) and C-PAP ventilation were immediately required. In the following days, laboratory tests showed significant increases of white blood cells (up to 30210/mm3) and lactate (up to 864 U/L), and low albumin (down to 2.27 g/dL). There was also a high increase of C-reactive protein up to 101.87 mg/L. On day 4, seric levels of the GM (Platelia Aspergillus; Biorad) and 1,3-\u03b2-D-glucan (Fungitell; Associates of Cape Cod Inc., Falmouth, Massachusetts, USA) were prescribed because of the patient's risk factors, which tested negative. On day 10 ventilator support with oro-tracheal intubation was implemented, due to a rapid decline of the patient's consciousness and respiratory quality. Because of a fever episode, antibiotic treatment with meropenem (3g/day) was started and a peripheral blood sample was taken for a microbiological culture, which tested negative. On the same day some surveillance exams were performed: cultures from rectal, nasal and pharyngeal swabs reported a normal microbiota, while a culture from a urinary sample revealed 100000 ufc/ml of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Because of this positive result the urinary catheter was removed and a therapeutic lavage with antibiotics was carried out, with complete resolution. On day 16 a new chest X-ray was performed that showed a pulmonary worsening ().\nAt the same time, new seric dosages were required: \u03b2-glucan serum level was 84 pg/mL while galactomannan had a T index of 4.9, suggestive of probable fungal angioinvasion. A bronchoaspirate sample was collected for bacteriological and mycological examinations, because of the persistence of high inflammation indices. For the mycological examination conventional methods by microscopic and fungal culture in Sabouraud's dextrose agar medium supplemented with chloramphenicol and gentamycin were performed. Molecular methods were also used and real-time PCR assay for the detection of Aspergillus was carried out. The AsperGenius\u00ae multiplex PCR (PathoNostics, The Netherlands) was used for the detection of the most clinically relevant Aspergillus species. DNA was extracted by using the GenoXtract instrument (Hain Lifescience, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed adding 5 \u03bcl of DNA extract to the PCR mix and a Rotor-Gene Q (Qiagen) was used for amplification and melting curve analysis. The direct microscopic examination with 15% potassium hydroxide (KOH) showed several hyaline septate hyphae and Aspergillus sp. was detected by PCR. After 72 h of incubation at 32 \u00b0C, the growth of numerous colonies was observed ().\nIdentification of the isolate was performed by standard phenotypic methods, based on macroscopic and microscopic morphological studies. The pathogen was identified as Aspergillus section Nigri. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry on a Microflex LT (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) platform after ethanol-formic acid extraction, identified the isolate as Aspergillus niger (score: 2.155). The same sample reported negative results from bacteriological examinations. Surveillance cultures from oropharyngeal, rectal and nasal swabs also revealed the presence of Aspergillus niger. Susceptibility to fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, flucytosine, caspofungin, anidulafungin, micafungin, and amphotericin B, was evaluated by the Sensititre\u00aeYeastOne method. MIC values of >256 \u03bcg/mL for fluconazole, 0.25 \u03bcg/mL for itraconazole, 1 \u03bcg/mL for voriconazole, 0.125 \u03bcg/mL for posaconazole, 2 \u03bcg/mL for flucytosine, and 0.12 \u03bcg/mL for amphotericin B were obtained. Echinocandins presented adequate minimum effective concentration (MEC) values: 0.03 \u03bcg/mL for micafungin, 0.015 \u03bcg/mL for caspofungin and 0.03 \u03bcg/mL for anidulafungin. Results showed various therapeutic options evaluated with dilution ranges and epidemiological cut-offs in the absence of clinical breakpoints []. Some literature reports evaluated the effectiveness of isavuconazole against the Aspergillus genus and the reliability of the MIC strip method for its susceptibility test [,]. According to these reports, the susceptibility test for isavuconazole was performed using the MIC strip method and showed a MIC value of 2 mg/L. The patient was put on voriconazole 800 mg/day.

Medications included carvedilol at a dose of 2.5 mg daily, furosemide at a dose of 40 mg daily, isosorbide dinitrate at a dose of 40 mg daily, and laxatives as needed. He quit smoking 10 years earlier after a 48-pack-year history, did not drink or use illicit drugs, and had no known allergies.\nOn examination, he was lethargic and drowsy, but responsive to simple commands. His blood pressure was 144/87 mmHg, pulse was 108 beats per minute, body temperature was 36.7 \u00baC, and respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute; his oxygen saturation was 79% while breathing ambient air and 94% while receiving oxygen through a face mask with a reservoir bag at a rate of 10 liters per minute. The jugular venous pulse was high at 10 cm of water. Chest auscultation revealed a gallop rhythm and bibasilar lung crackles. The abdomen was soft and nondistended, and there was no edema of the legs.\nAn electrocardiogram demonstrated a normal sinus rhythm, right bundle branch block, small q waves in the inferior leads, slight ST-elevation in aVR, and ST-segment depressions in leads V3 to V6 (). Bilateral opacities in the lower lung fields were observed on an anteroposterior chest radiograph (), and diffusely decreased wall motion in the left ventricle was noted on bedside echocardiography. Arterial blood gases, obtained with supplemental oxygen, revealed a pH of 7.256, partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 29.5 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen of 93.8 mmHg, and lactate of 121 mg/dL.

In addition, he required oxygen by nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. He had a large-volume central pulse, no extra heart sounds and soft systolic and early diastolic murmurs over the aortic valve. His jugular venous pressure was 4cm above the sternal angle, and he had crackles at both lung bases. There were no features suggestive of Marfan syndrome or connective tissue diseases. The initial emergency work-up included an electrocardiogram (EKG), which showed left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization abnormalities; a chest X-ray with increased interstitial markings suggesting acute pulmonary edema; a troponin I level of 0.41\u03bcg/L; and a brain natriuretic peptide level of 487ng/L.\nOn the basis of the patient\u2019s abrupt onset of symptoms, family history of aortic dissection and findings consistent with acute aortic insufficiency (large-volume pulse, early diastolic murmur and heart failure), an emergent contrast-enhanced CT scan was obtained (Figure ). This scan showed a 5cm aortic root aneurysm but no aortic dissection. The patient was treated medically for acute coronary syndrome and heart failure, including dual anti-platelet therapy and anti-coagulation. He was subsequently transferred to a tertiary care hospital. Because of the high clinical suspicion of an acute aortic dissection based on his family history, sudden onset chest discomfort and findings of acute aortic insufficiency and heart failure [], a transesophageal echocardiogram was taken, even in light of the negative CT scan (Figure ).

From the time of onset, the pain was categorized to be severe, not colic and was localized to the epigastric region only. The patient was alert and ill, while she has had nausea and anorexia, but was not been accompanied by vomiting. Her vital signs were as follows: BP: 85/50, PR: 130, T: 37.2, and RR: 18. Her head, neck, and chest (heart and lung) were normal, and abdomen was fatty and without scarlet and reduced intestinal sounds. She had generalized tenderness with maximum pain intensity in epigastric regions, where her organs were normal. Her medical and corresponding drug history was as follows: antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, DVT, a history of two abortions, and type II diabetes.\nHer drug history included: prednisolone tablets, 5 mg: once a day; methotrexate: three pounds a week; hydroxychloroquine tablet: 3 days a week; and warfarin tablets: daily half a pill and insulin.\nFor further examination, her cardiac activity was monitored, and serum therapy was given to the patient. She was also provided a nasogastric tube, Foley catheter for urinary drainage along with hydrocortisone and antibiotics.\nAfter about 60 minutes, her vitals were as follows: BP: 100/60 and PR: 120.\nThe result of the preliminary tests showed WBC: 4200, Hb: 7.7, PLT: 80 000, and INR: 4.7 and other tests: normal. Ultrasound from the patient's bedside showed free fluid in the abdomen. Following these tests, the therapeutic intervention was continued as follows: serum, wo packed cell (PC) units, and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) units. Meanwhile, the patient was prepared for laparotomy where, during the surgery, her sugar levels kept under control, control, stress-dose cortisol was provided, and she received 5 units of PC and 4 units of FFP.\nDuring the laparotomy, about 3 L of blood and clot were removed from the abdomen. Following this, a cystic lesion was observed in the vicinity of the large stomach flexion that bled due to the invasion of the gastroepyloid vessels (Figure ). After controlling the bleeding, the lesion was fully resected, and samples were examined for pathology (Figure ).\nPostoperatively, complete control of the bleeding was achieved with sustained vital signs. However, given the state of preoperative hemorrhagic shock, the patient was kept in ICU until satisfactory recovery was achieved. She also received 5 units of PC and 4 units of FFP, and the vital signs were maintained stable.\nDespite there was no recurrence of hemorrhage, she presented pancytopenia perhaps due to the underlying disease (antiphospholipid antibody syndrome). She was hyper-coagulopathic, due to thrombocytopenia and hemorrhagic shock (cause of referral); therefore, anticoagulant administration was not possible.\nAfter 24 hours and ensuring the stability of vital signs and the absence of Ileus, the patient oral feed was resumed. The postoperative examination for pancytopenia was as follows: WBC: 1500 (PMN: 60%), Hb: 11, PLT: 50 000, INR: 1.7, and K: 3.2. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) therapy was prescribed to the patients after which, her platelets and WBCs showed improvement. The patient's general condition improved, she tolerated the diet, and the bleeding was controlled. Her hemoglobin level did not drop, and therefore, she was transferred to the general ward.\nThe continuation of treatment was as follows: hydroxychloroquine, prednisolone: half a tablet twice a day, methotrexate was discontinued for 2 weeks, and folic acid and GCSF for 3 days.\nLaboratory results showed: platelet <100 000, potassium <3.5, and INR: 1.6. She was administered anticoagulant prophylaxis.\nNine days after the operation, the patient suffered from shortness of breath and tachypnea and a feeling of pressure in the chest. According to the history of the disease, the first diagnosis was a pulmonary embolism, for which anticoagulant therapy was immediately initiated and the patient was transferred to ICU. Her laboratory findings revealed: a decrease in platelets 20 000 and an increase in INR > 3 while ECG was normal. Anticoagulant therapy was restarted.

There was no evidence of free air, abscess formation, migration of the foreign body into the pancreas, or pancreatitis (Fig. b).\nAs the patient had a history of fish bone ingestion, we made a diagnosis of localized peritonitis caused by fish bone penetration of the posterior wall of the gastric antrum. We first attempted to remove the foreign body endoscopically, but failed because it was not detected. Hence, an emergency laparoscopic surgery was performed. The patient was placed in a supine position. The operator stood on the left side of the patient, the assistant on the right side, and the scopist between the patient\u2019s legs. Four trocars were placed: one above the navel for the laparoscopy (12 mm), two in the upper left abdominal quadrant (5 mm), and one in the upper right abdominal quadrant (5 mm).

A linear, hard, foreign body was found in the adhesive tissue between the gastric antrum and the pancreatic body (Fig. a). The foreign body was safely removed from both the pancreas and stomach laparoscopically. The foreign body was identified as a 2.5-cm-long fish bone, (Fig. b). The length of the fish bone embedded in the pancreas was about 2 cm. There was a minor laceration at the site of the pancreatic injury. Neither fat saponification nor hematoma around the pancreas was identified. We did not perform suture repair or local debridement for the site of the pancreatic injury. Because the site of the penetrated gastric wall was small and a leak was not observed, we did not perform suture repair or cover the site of the penetrated gastric wall with the omentum.

Her past medical history was significant for bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, which was incidentally diagnosed on a routine chest radiograph 8 years previously, a finding that was confirmed, together with right paratracheal node enlargement, by a chest computed tomography (CT) scan. She had then undergone a non-diagnostic bronchoscopy and was advised to repeat the chest CT scan after 6 months, advice she ignored. She had never smoked and she had not taken any medication in the past. She had no environmental or occupational history of beryllium or other metal exposure. She had never traveled outside Greece. She had never had a tuberculin test.\nOn physical examination, the patient appeared to be in good condition, mildly dyspneic with 22 breaths per minute, a temperature of 39.4\u00b0C, blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg and a heart rate of 100 beats per minute. Apart from mild bilateral inspiratory fine crackles in the lower lung fields, no other physical abnormalities were observed. There was no skin involvement.

However, both blood and sputum culture results were negative.\nShe was diagnosed with drug-induced agranulocytosis (presumably from antibiotics used) with mild pneumonia and admitted to an isolated room. Candesartan, lansoprazole, amlodipine, and celecoxib were discontinued because they are also known to cause agranulocytosis. She was given meropenem hydrate intravenously (2 g/day) and levofloxacin hydrate orally (500 mg/day) for 10 days, after which a short course of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (4 g/day) was administered. Subcutaneous injection of filgrastim (recombinant human G-CSF, 75 \u00b5g/day) was also given to treat her neutropenia.\nFilgrastim was administered for 6 days before the neutrophil count normalized to 2539/\u00b5L on day 6.

She is from an average Sri Lankan middle class family with no significant family history of ovarian disease and with an average socioeconomic background. She was vaccinated in concordance with the extended immunization schedule of Sri Lanka and there were no significant environmental hazards. She was seen by her general practitioner 3 days prior with postprandial vomiting with no associated diarrhea, constipation, or urinary symptoms. She was otherwise well and was not in pain. She was diagnosed as having acute gastroenteritis. On the third day of the illness, as the symptoms persisted, she was admitted to our hospital for further evaluation.\nOn examination, she was not in pain but noted to be bent forward while walking. She was comfortable in the seated position and was playful. An examination of her vital signs revealed that they were normal for her age with good hydration and her axillary temperature was 36.2 \u00b0C. A cardiovascular system examination revealed a pulse rate of 97 beats/minute, and blood pressure of 96/70 mmHg. Her respiratory rate was 24 breaths/minute and her oxygen saturation 100% on room air without any features suggestive of respiratory distress. The rest of the detailed examination of her cardiovascular and respiratory systems did not reveal any abnormalities. She was rational and conscious with no features suggestive of past or acute neurological deficits. On examination of her abdomen, there was guarding, which was mainly confined to the lower abdomen, equally on both sides. There were no classic clinical features such as severe tenderness on the right inguinal fossa and rebound tenderness to suggest appendicitis. There were no hepatosplenomegaly or ballotable kidneys.\nOur patient\u2019s white blood cell count was elevated to 14,700/mm3 with 53% lymphocytes and 45% leukocytes. Her hemoglobin and platelet counts were within normal limits. Her C-reactive protein concentration was 42.6 mg/l. Her urine analysis showed 30\u201340 white blood cells and 2\u20134 red blood cells. There were trace amounts of protein with significant amounts of ketone bodies. Therefore, on the day of admission, a tentative diagnosis of urinary tract infection was made and she was started on intravenous gentamicin 5 mg/kg/day. A urine culture did not grow any organisms. There was no bacterial growth in her blood culture. Renal function, liver profiles, serum electrolytes, and other basic biochemical investigation results were within normal limits.\nAn abdominopelvic ultrasound scan revealed a mixed but predominantly hyperechoic mass on the pouch of Douglas on her right side measuring 5 cm \u00d7 2.5 cm \u00d7 3 cm suggestive of ovarian cyst (Fig. ). Her left ovary was normal. There was no evidence of appendicitis or pyelonephritis. A magnetic resonance imaging scan of her abdomen revealed an enlarged right ovary with hemorrhages at various stages with multiple enlarged follicles within it, which was suggestive of OT (Fig. a\u2013d). It did not show any enhancement with intravenous gadolinium.\nExploratory laparoscopy revealed a twisted gangrenous right ovary (Fig. ) following which an oophorectomy was performed as no viable ovarian tissue was noticed.

His medical history showed that he had been diagnosed with pneumonia several times by a local physician, and was hospitalized five times and treated with intravenous antibiotics. Following each hospitalization and treatment his fever resolved, but cough persisted. His family history was not significant. He had a negative history of contact with active tuberculous and had not received the Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine.\nThe patient presented to our hospital upon referral for further evaluation of the underlying cause of recurrent pneumonia. Physical examination showed he was malnourished and pale; his weight was 8.2 kg (<5th percentile), height was 73 cm (<5th percentile), body temperature was 37\u00b0C, blood pressure was 100/60 mm Hg, and heart rate was 112 beats per min. There was no BCG scar. He was tachypneic at 56 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation was 89% on room air. His respiratory sounds were rough and anteroposterior diameter of the chest was increased. There was abdominal distention and mild hepatomegaly, without splenic enlargement. Musculoskeletal examination revealed moderate thoracic kyphosis. Initial laboratory findings were as follows: White blood cell count 22.000/\u03bcL with 26% lymphocytes and 74% polymorphonuclear leukocytes; hemoglobin 9.8 g/dL; platelet count 809.000/\u03bcL; the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 65 mm/h (normal: <20 mm/h), C-reactive protein 31.5 mg/L (normal: <2.9 mg/L). Serum electrolytes, renal and hepatic function test results were normal. Chest X-ray showed atelectasis and consolidation in the upper lobe of the right lung, and perihilar and pericardial infiltration in the left lung.\nHe was hospitalized and empirical intravenous cefepime was commenced for the non-specific treatment of pneumonia. Immunologic examinations were performed to determine the underlying cause of recurrent pneumonia. Serum quantitative immunoglobulin levels, the absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, and the CH50 level were in normal range. The nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test result was 100%. Investigation of bone marrow smear showed no abnormalities. Thoracic computed tomography (CT) showed multiple paratracheal, precarinal, and right hilar lymph nodes, and consolidation in the middle and inferior lobes of the right lung and the inferior lobe of the left lung. Additionally, there was a 2-cm thick retroperitoneal soft tissue mass destroying the T7-8 and L1-L2 vertebral bodies, and infiltrating the spinal cord, pushing the aorta anteriorly. The mass extended from the level of bifurcation of the aorta to the bottom of the diaphragm and contained punctuate calcification. In addition to these findings, spinal MRI showed signal intensity changes in compatible with spinal cord edema, and an abscess extending to the medial fibers of the right and left psoas muscle at the L1-L3 level. Abdominal ultrasonography (USG) showed hepatomegaly and several calcifications in the liver, and widespread splenic calcifications. Tuberculin skin test (TST) was negative. Early morning gastric aspirate and urine were negative for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). We preliminarily diagnosed the patient with miliary TB and Pott's disease, and began administering antituberculous treatment consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide on day 11 of hospitalization.\nTru-Cut biopsy for Pott's abscess was performed on day 14 of hospitalization, and AFB analysis and mycobacterial culture of the biopsy specimen was positive, whereas PCRs of biopsy specimen were negative. Histopathological examination showed severe degeneration and necrosis of muscle fibers. Mycobacterial culture and PCR of gastric aspirate were also positive, and as such definitive diagnoses of miliary TB, tuberculous spondylitis, and tuberculous iliopsoas abscess were established. Screening of household contacts did not identify any cases of active TB. The patient's condition progressively improved; respiratory symptoms and findings resolved, and he began to gain weight during the following weeks. The patient was discharged after 28 day of anti-TB treatment. After 2 months of treatment, the anti-TB medication regimen was reduced to rifampin and isoniazid. After the 11th month of anti-TB treatment, spinal MRI findings were normal, except for angulation at the T9 level. Furthermore, thoracic CT was completely normal, but abdominal USG showed that hepatosplenic calcifications persisted. The patient completed 12 months of anti-TB therapy without any adverse effect. At the end of the anti-TB therapy all of the patient's symptoms were relieved and he was well except for kyphosis. The patient's family declined surgery to correct his kyphosis. Six years after completion of treatment, he had thoracic kyphosis, his height was under the 3 percentile. His throracic kyphosis deformity at 9 years old is demonstrated in . Control MRI in sagittal T2-weighted images revealed kyphosis at the level of T 7-8 vertebra due to the collapsed vertebral body. The signal intensity is normal as it is in chronic stage. The L1-3 vertebrae are also collapsed. No soft tissue mass consistent with abscess is observed.

She also had gastrointestinal symptoms, such as anorexia, nausea, and diarrhea later, and visited a local clinic on July 30. She was prescribed antipyretic analgesics and returned home. The following day, she developed a mild consciousness disorder and visited a local clinic again accompanied by her family. She underwent a magnetic resonance imaging examination, but no abnormality was noted. However, laboratory data showed leukocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and creatine kinase (CK) levels. She was transported to Kagoshima University Hospital.\nOn admission, she had a slight disturbance of consciousness [Glasgow Coma Scale of 14: E3, V5, M6], a body temperature of 37.4 \u00b0C, a respiratory rate of 22/min, blood pressure of 109/73 mmHg, heart rate of 97/min, SpO2 of 99% (room air), normal heart and respiratory sound, no swelling of the superficial lymph nodes, crusty bite wounds in the left inguinal region, although there was no tick. Laboratory testing showed leukocytopenia (total white blood cell count of 910 cells/mm3); thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 63,000 cells/mm3); mildly elevated AST (68 U/L), lactate dehydrogenase (364 IU/L), and CK (317 U/L) levels; elevated ferritin level (1947 ng/mL); and normal CK-MB fraction (CK-MB) (4 U/L) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level (< 0.02 mg/dL). A urinary general examination showed protein (4+) and occult blood (3+). Electrocardiography (ECG) and chest radiography findings were normal on the day of admission (day 1).\nBecause of these clinical findings, she was suspected of having SFTS and transferred to the intensive care unit. Several hours after admission, SFTSV RNA was detected in her serum samples by RT-PCR, so she was definitively diagnosed as having SFTS.\nHer clinical course is shown in Fig. . Her blood pressure gradually started to decrease from day 2 evening. Fluid resuscitation (100 ml/h for 10 h; crystalloids 500 ml, colloids 500 ml) was performed until day 3 morning because hand-held ultrasound on day 2 midnight showed collapsed IVC (inferior vena cava). Then, repeat hand-held ultrasound showed recover from collapsed IVC; nevertheless, her blood pressure had not recovered and administration of low doses of dopamine and norepinephrine was started. To exclude cardiogenic shock, trans-thoracic echocardiography was performed and showed diffuse left ventricular (LV) wall motion depression (with an EF: ejection fraction of 34.4%), diffuse LV wall thickening, and small amount of pericardial effusion. Further, ECG showed ST elevation in the II, III, aVf, and V2\u20136 leads and a low-voltage complex in all leads (Fig. ), and the level of troponin I was elevated (120.9 ng/mL), but that of CK-MB was not. She did not have any chest symptoms. She met several diagnostic criteria for clinically suspected myocarditis [], which include unexplained cardiogenic shock, elevated level of troponin I, abnormal ECG and echocardiographic findings. In addition, she also met criteria for fulminant myocarditis [], which include acute illness (history of < 2\u20134 weeks since the onset of symptoms), hemodynamic instability due to cardiogenic shock, and need for hemodynamic support (inotrope). Therefore, she was suspected of having fulminant myocarditis caused by SFTSV. However, we did not perform coronary angiography (CAG) or endomyocardial biopsy because thrombocytopenia and leukocytopenia greatly increased the risk of an invasive procedure. We screened for other viruses, including enterovirus, adenovirus, and influenza viruses that may cause myocarditis, but none of them were detected in nasal swab samples.\nOn day 5 of hospitalization, repeat echocardiography showed further LV dysfunction (with an EF of 27.9%), diffuse LV wall thickening (septum/posterior wall: 14.7 mm/13.5 mm), and narrowing of the left ventricular cavity (Fig. ). On the basis of these results, administration of low doses of dobutamine and milrinone was added. On day 6 of hospitalization, repeat echocardiography showed cardiac tamponade findings of the dilated IVC without respiratory variations and right ventricular diastolic collapse (Fig. ). However, no surgical pericardial puncture was performed, because there was no safe puncture space and a circulation agonist was able to maintain blood pressure. After that, echocardiography showed steady improvement of LV function (EF) and wall thickness, the urine output also continued to increase and the water balance gradually leaned toward negative as a result (Fig. ). Additionally, the pericardial effusion gradually decreased and the cardiac tamponade findings naturally disappeared. On day 11 of hospitalization, her mild disturbance of consciousness from admission had improved, and she no longer needed a circulatory agonist. On day 13 of hospitalization, ECG showed improvement of ST elevation in the II, III, aVf, and V2\u20136 leads. She was eventually transferred to a general ward on the same day. On day 17 of hospitalization, repeat echocardiography showed normal LV function (with an EF of 70.3%) and wall thickness (septum/posterior wall: 8.9 mm/9.4 mm) (Fig. ).\nOn day 20 of hospitalization, laboratory testing and ECG showed no abnormal findings. After exercise rehabilitation, she was discharged home on day 28 of hospitalization.\nShe had no history of cardiac diseases, allergy, or use of drugs that may cause myocarditis. During 28 days of hospitalization, CRP and bacterial culture were always negative, and there was no evidence of eosinophil elevation. Viruses, other than SFTSV, were not detected by virus isolation test.

Patient had total parathyroidectomy and partial thyroidectomy three weeks ago for primary hyperparathyroidism caused by parathyroid adenomas. Serum calcium level at the referring facility was 21 mg/dL. EKG showed prolonged QTc of 476 ms and nonspecific ST-T wave changes, she denied chest pain and troponin levels were <0.015. At the time of admission in our facility, her vital signs were temperature 97.9 F, heart rate 87 bpm, respiratory rate 16/min and blood pressure 163/67 mmHg. She was alert and oriented, had normal reflexes through symmetrically decreased muscle strength in all four extremities with mild generalized abdominal tenderness. Rest of the physical exam was unremarkable. Patient\u2019s initial laboratory values showed white blood cell (WBC) count of 15.5 k/mm3, hemoglobin (Hb) of 15.6 gm/dL, platelet count of 370 k/mm3, creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL (baseline was 0.8), BUN of 45 mg/dL, eGFR of 27 mL/min (baseline eGFR >60 mL/min), bicarbonate of 33 mEq/L, chloride of 94 mEq/L, potassium of 2.5 mEq/L, sodium of 135 mEq/L, total calcium of 23 mg/dL with ionized calcium of 12.03 mg/dL, phosphate of 1.3 mg/dL and PTH of 0. Her 25 hydroxyvitamin D level was 61 ng/mL (normal 30-100 ng/mL) and 1-25 hydroxyvitamin D3 level was 31 pg/ml (normal 18-72 pg/mL) (Table ).\nWhen asked about medication history, patient reported 3 g calcium carbonate intake daily, calcitriol 0.5 mcg twice daily, cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) 10,000 units once daily, chlorthalidone 25 mg once daily and irbesartan 300 mg once daily. Her diet included a glass of milk after each meal. As explained earlier, a diagnosis of CATS was made, and treatment was started. It was obvious from history that hypercalcemia was due to excessive calcium intake so calcium, vitamin D supplements and chlorthalidone were stopped. Irbesartan contributing to AKI was also stopped. Aggressive hydration was instituted with intravenous (IV) normal saline 150-200 mL/hour with 4L given in the first 24 hours. Furosemide 40 mg twice daily was also started. Patient didn\u2019t require calcitonin. Due to the anticipated serious risk of late hypocalcemia owing to parathyroidectomy, bisphosphonates were not considered. Patient improved clinically and her symptoms resolved, she was discharged on hospital day 5, with total calcium level reduced to 10.3 mg/dL and ionized calcium to 5.77 mg/dL.

Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed an abscess in the left lower lobe of his lung, and clinical laboratory tests showed elevated white blood cells of 13,200/\u03bcl (normal range, 4000\u20138000/\u03bcl) and C-reactive protein of 5.97 mg/dl (normal range, < 0.40 mg/dl). Treatment with sulbactam/ampicillin was initiated. Since no improvements were confirmed by the imaging and laboratory findings, antimicrobial treatment was changed to tazobactam/piperacillin on day 3 post admission, and was subsequently changed to meropenem (MEPM) on day 25 post admission. Treatment with voriconazole (VRCZ) was added on day 17 post admission because his \u03b2-D-glucan level reached to 123 pg/ml (normal range, < 20 pg/ml). However, it was discontinued 8 days later. Transbronchial biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage performed to assess the mass did not detect malignancy or significant levels of bacteria, including mycobacteria and fungi. On day 27, the patient was referred to our tertiary center for further examination and treatment by specialists in respirology and infection and potential thoracic surgery. Since the definitive diagnosis could not be made, the patient was transferred to our hospital for further examination and treatment on day 27.\nOn admission, his vital signs were as follows: a body temperature of 36.6 \u00b0C, blood pressure of 120/66 mmHg, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. The arterial oxygen saturation measured via pulse oximetry was 98% in the examination room. A physical examination including respiratory sound revealed no significant finding. Clinical laboratory tests showed that the patient had elevated C-reactive protein levels of 15.56 mg/dl (normal range, < 0.40 mg/dl) and his Aspergillus antigen test was positive (cut-off index of 3.5). Human immunodeficiency virus antibody and interferon-gamma releasing assay were negative. In addition, the \u03b2-D-glucan level decreased to a normal range (14.7 pg/ml). Chest X-ray and contrast-enhanced CT were performed on admission. Chest X-ray showed an infiltrative shadow in the left lower lung field (Fig. ), and CT showed a massive lesion in the left lower lobe of the lung, emphysematous changes, ectatic bronchi, and a nodular lesion that was thought to contain a mucoid impaction within its lingular segment. The bronchus was disrupted proximal to the mass lesion of the left lower lobe (Fig. a\u2013c). Consequently, bronchial atresia in the inferior and anterior basal segments of the left lung was suspected based on imaging findings. Since the presence of a malignant lesion could not be excluded, bronchoscopy was performed on day 2 after transfer to our hospital. An endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration was performed on the small mass lesion near the left second carina (Fig. d). The disrupted bronchus could not be confirmed via bronchoscopy because the disrupted site was located too peripherally. Histopathological analyses revealed no malignant findings, but presence of a filamentous fungus was indicated in Grocott staining (Fig. ). Although cultures did not detect any microorganisms, based on these findings, a lung abscess due to Aspergillus spp. was suspected. Therefore, VRCZ was reintroduced on day 9 after transfer. To perform treatment and confirm the suspected diagnosis of a lung abscess due to an Aspergillus infection, the patient underwent surgical resection of the lingular and basal segments of the left lung on day 22 after transfer. The abscess formation was macroscopically confirmed (Fig. ), and histopathological examination revealed emphysematous changes and ectatic bronchi within the lingular and left basal segments (Fig. a, b). These findings were compatible with bronchial atresia [], and no malignant lesions were confirmed. Although histopathological analyses did not reveal filamentous fungus, a tissue culture resulted in A. fumigatus growth. MEPM and intravenous VRCZ were continued for a total of 4 weeks and 3 weeks, respectively, and the patient was discharged on day 32 after transfer with continuing oral treatment with VRCZ. VRCZ was discontinued 5 months after the initiation of treatment because of poor medication compliance and the side effect of alopecia, and subsequent recurrence of the infection has not been confirmed.", "Question": "What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?", "LLM Answer": "3", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "2", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0.\nThe patient's temperature is 36.6 degrees celsius.

He had a 16-year history of organic psychiatric disorder induced by a large hematoma and contusion of the brain following injury in a traffic accident. Because of delusions of persecution and severe irritability, the patient was treated with several antipsychotics and mood stabilizers, including zotepine (400 mg/day for 6 years), risperidone (12 mg/day for 8 years), paliperidone (12 mg/day for 3 years), olanzapine (20 mg/day for 8 years), and lithium (1200 mg/day for 6 years). His serum lithium concentration ranged from 0.75 to 1.35 mEq/mL.\nThe patient\u2019s clinical course is shown in Fig. . At admission, the patient\u2019s height was 176.1 cm and his body weight was 77.1 kg. His blood pressure was 136/102 mmHg and his pulse rate was 111 beats per minute. His body temperature was 37.6 \u00b0C on admission (Day 1). Laboratory examinations on Day 2 revealed a white blood cell count of 11,480/mL (range 3500\u20138500), C-reactive protein of 2.89 mg/dL (range 0.00\u20130.30), aspartate transaminase of 130 U/L (range 13\u201333), alanine transaminase of 245 U/L (range 8\u201342), alkaline phosphatase of 692 U/L (range 115\u2013359), lactate dehydrogenase of 230 U/L (range 119\u2013229), total bilirubin of 6.3 mg/dL (range 0.3\u20131.2), \u03b3-glutamyltransferase of 348 U/L (range 10\u201347), amylase of 128 U/L (range 37\u2013125), serum creatinine of 0.92 mg/dL (range 0.6\u20131.1), urea nitrogen of 5 mg/dL (range 8\u201322), serum sodium of 156 mmol/L (range 138\u2013146), serum potassium of 3.7 mmol/L (range 3.6\u20134.9), and serum chloride of 114 mmol/L (range 99\u2013109).\nBecause the patient\u2019s polyuria was > 4000 mL/day, he received 3200 mL/day of 5% glucose perioperatively (Days 6\u201312). However, his serum sodium levels remained between 150 and 160 mmol/L. Plasma and urine osmolality were 318 mOsm/L and 141 mOsm/L, respectively, while the serum arginine vasopressin level was 6.4 pg/mL (range 0.0\u20133.8). Desmopressin was ineffective, resulting in a diagnosis of NDI. Nine days after admission (Day 9), laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. We gradually withdrew lithium starting on Day 15 because it was the suspected cause of NDI. Lithium was completely discontinued on Day 19. Urine volume increased further to a maximum of 10,000 mL/day. Because the patient had free water excretion resulting from NDI and we wanted to avoid excessive glucose to prevent diabetes mellitus, rehydration therapy with xylitol infusion was initiated. A maximum of 10,000 mL/day of 5% xylitol was administered for 8 days (Days 13\u201320).\nThe patient\u2019s serum lithium concentration was 0.89 mEq/mL on Day 15. He developed lethargy on Day 19, although laboratory examinations showed no remarkable change (serum creatinine = 1.05 mg/dL, urea nitrogen = 8 mg/dL, serum sodium = 152 mmol/L). His consciousness level declined and his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 6 points (E4V1M1) with metabolic acidosis on Day 20. The patient did not show meningeal signs, involuntary movements, or generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizures. He had decreased muscle tension/tonus and deep tendon reflexes but showed jaw jerk reflex and snout reflex; a brainstem lesion was suspected. The patient maintained spontaneous breathing.\nArterial blood gas testing without oxygen therapy on Day 20 showed the following: fraction of inspired oxygen 0.21 (room air), pH 7.28 (range 7.36\u20137.44), carbon dioxide partial pressure = 14.7 (range 35.0\u201345.0), partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood = 117.0 (range 75.0\u201395.0), hydrogen carbonate ion = 6.7 (range 22.0\u201328.0), and base excess = \u2212 18.7 (range 23.0\u201327.0). Laboratory examinations revealed the following: serum creatinine = 1.58 mg/dL, urea nitrogen = 9 mg/dL, serum sodium = 155 mmol/L, serum potassium = 3.5 mmol/L, and serum chloride = 125 mmol/L. Computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging on Day 20 revealed brain edema but no cerebral herniation or findings of osmotic demyelination syndrome. Continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF) was temporarily performed from Days 20 to 23, which corrected the patient\u2019s metabolic acidosis. His consciousness level improved and his GCS rose to 12 points (E4V3M5) by Day 23. At that time, the patient showed normal brain stem reactions and deep tendon reflexes. He responded to a handshake. His serum lithium concentration was 0.05 mEq/mL on Day 22. However, his urine volume remained at approximately 3000 mL/day, serum sodium remained in the 150 mmol/L range, and serum creatinine increased to 4.74 mg/dL on Day 26. Urinalysis showed no remarkable findings throughout the examination period.\nThe patient\u2019s serum sodium was in the high 140 mmol/L range and his creatinine level was near 1.5 mg/dL on Day 50. However, polyuria and polydipsia of approximately 4000 mL/day persisted. Renal biopsy on Day 60 showed deposition of double-refractive crystals in the cortical renal tubules. Tubular atrophy, macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration, and interstitial fibrosis were observed in parts of the tubulointerstitium. Decreased expression of water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) was observed in the cortical and medullary renal tubules (Fig. ); no urinary AQP2 was detected on ELISA (Human Aquaporin 2 ELISA Kit, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The diagnosis was lithium-induced NDI and cerebrorenal oxalosis induced by excess xylitol infusion.\nLaboratory examinations on Day 80 revealed the following: serum creatinine = 1.25 mg/dL, urea nitrogen = 7 mg/dL, serum sodium = 147 mmol/L, plasma osmolality = 297 mOsm/L, and urine osmolality = 106 mOsm/L. The patient was discharged 82 days after admission; his thirst gradually decreased to 1500 to 2000 mL of water per day by 2 months after discharge. Urinary AQP2 levels increased to 1.14 ng/mg/g of creatinine and serum creatinine decreased to a low of 0.90 mg/dL. However, plasma and urine osmolality were 292 mOsm/L and 62 mOsm/L, respectively, 4 months after discontinuing lithium.

She had a chest X-ray before a gastrofibroscopy at a local hospital. There were multiple rib fractures (). For further evaluation, she had a chest computed tomography (CT) scan done before visiting our hospital. The chest CT revealed multiple sclerotic masses with bone destruction in both hemithoraxes (right 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 10th ribs, left 2nd, 4th, 7th, 8th, and 9th ribs) of variable size (). Initially she was admitted to the pulmonology department to rule out bony metastases from a cancer of unknown origin. She had taken the bone densitometry of the L1-L4 lumbar spine by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), at the local department of gynecology 1.5 years ago. The result of bone mineral density (BMD) was 0.726 g/cm2 and the average T-score of the L1-L4 lumbar spine was -2.6. The average Z-score of the L1-L4 lumbar spine was -2.0. Therefore, she was taking calcium, vitamin D supplements and hormone replacement therapy for osteoporosis. She also had a conization in 2002 due to squamous cell carcinoma in situ at the uterine cervix and thereafter received a total hysterectomy in 2005 due to uterine leiomyoma. She had no alcohol drinking or smoking history. There were no abnormal findings in her family history. Also, she had no trauma history. She did not have moon face, buffalo hump, or abdominal straie. She didn't have any pain on her ribs. On the physical examination, there wasn't tenderness around fracture sites. Her height and weight were 153 cm and 53 kg, respectively, with a body mass index (BMI) of 22 kg/m2. Her waist measurement was 83 cm, and she had experienced no recent weight changes. Her blood pressure was 140/80 mmHg with a pulse of 96 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min, and a body temperature of 36.8\u2103. On the blood test, the leukocyte, hemoglobin, and platelet counts were 8,900/mm3 (neutrophils 85.9%, lymphocyte 8.4%, monocyte 5.7%), 14.9 g/dL, and 184,000/\u00b5L, respectively. Fasting glucose, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and creatinine were 93 mg/dL, 4.0 g/dL, 45 IU/L, 81 IU/L, 49 IU/L, and 0.56 mg/dL, respectively. Total calcium and phosphate were 10.5 mg/dL and 3.5 mg/dL, respectively. In addition, serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) was 35.6 pg/mL (normal range, 13-54 pg/mL).\nTo evaluate the patient for metastatic cancer, a bone biopsy was performed at the right 6th rib posterior arc in the pulmonology department. Also a bone scan and the bone densitometry of the L1-L4 lumbar spine and an abdominal CT were performed. Fragmented bony particles with small amounts of marrow tissue were observed in the biopsy tissue.\nThere were no cancer cells nor cytokeratin (CK)-positive epithelial cells on immunohistochemical staining. There was no cancerous lesion in abdomen CT, except a left adrenal incidentaloma, a well-marginated soft tissue mass 25 mm in diameter, was found (). On the bone scan, multi-focal increased uptake was observed in both ribs, suggesting non-traumatic micro-fractures caused by osteoporosis (). The average BMD, T-score and Z-score of the L1-L4 lumbar spine was 0.761 g/cm2, -2.1 and -1.7, respectively. Therefore, an endocrine cause of osteoporotic fracture was suspected, and a hormonal study for adrenal incidentaloma was performed. Free cortisol in the urine and 17-hydroxycorticosteroid were 580.4 \u00b5g/day (normal range, 20-90 \u00b5g/day) and 12.93 mg/day (normal range, 3-15 mg/day), respectively. A low-dose dexamethasone suppression test showed that the serum adrenocorticotrophic hormone level was 1.4 pg/mL (normal <130 pg/mL), the basal cortisol was 26.3 \u00b5g/dL and the cortisol on the 3rd day was 35.4 \u00b5g/dL (normal, 3-6 \u00b5g/dL). Cortisol was not suppressed. Finally, she was diagnosed with Cushing's syndrome due to the left adrenocortical adenoma. A laparoscopic left adrenalectomy was performed in June 2009. A month after the laparoscopic left adrenalectomy, 24-hr urine free cortisol was checked, and was below 1.8 \u00b5g/day. A bone scan taken 1 year after the operation showed decreased multifocal uptake in the bilateral ribs () and the patient's BMD improved gradually, reaching 0.822 g/cm2 in 2012 (). Also, the average T-score and Z-score of the L1-L4 lumbar spine improved, reaching -1.6 and -1.0, respectively.

The left internal jugular vein and left radial artery were accessed for monitoring. Standard induction was performed. The ventilation mode was volume-controlled ventilation with a tidal volume of 8 mL/kg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths/minute, and inspired oxygen fraction of 50% with no positive end-expiratory pressure. The patient was then placed in the left lateral recumbent position. Her PETCO2 before the introduction of CO2 pneumoperitoneum was 37 mmHg, and her SpO2 was 100%.\nTEE (Vivid E95; GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) examination revealed no abnormality. Trocars were placed in the abdominal cavity at three sites (the navel, the subcostal margin at the midline of the clavicle, and the intersection of the anterior axillary line and level of the navel). The CO2 pneumoperitoneum was established at a pressure of 15 mmHg. Ten minutes after the introduction of CO2 pneumoperitoneum, while the surgeons were dissecting the perirenal fat without significant bleeding, TEE showed a sudden increase in small gas bubbles in the RA and small bubbles in the RV. The patient was immediately placed in the Trendelenburg position. About 8 minutes later, TEE showed a large amount of gas bubbles in the left atrium, left ventricle, ascending aorta, and pulmonary artery (). At the same time, the PETCO2 began to fall to 20 mmHg from 37 mmHg, and this decrease lasted for 20 minutes. There were no changes in the patient\u2019s pulse, blood pressure, SpO2, or electrocardiogram parameters.\nWe quickly increased the fraction of inspired oxygen to 100%. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed a pH of 7.27, arterial oxygen pressure of 161 mmHg, arterial CO2 pressure of 65 mmHg, and lactic acid concentration of 2.4 mmol/L. After communication with the surgeon, the pneumoperitoneum pressure was reduced to 10 mmHg. Meanwhile, gas bubbles could still be seen in the whole heart, the hepatic vein, and the IVC (). There was no regional wall motion abnormality, and the RV was normal. Color ultrasonography showed no defect in the atrial septum or ventricular septum and no patent foramen ovale (PFO).\nNine hours after the operation, the patient exhibited slurred speech and developed an epileptiform seizure in the ward. After the seizure, the muscle strength of both limbs was weakened. The blood myoglobin and lactic acid concentrations were increased. However, a computed tomography scan showed no obvious infarction or hemorrhage.

The proband was born at full term. Psychomotor development of the proband was delayed. He attended a regular school until the age of 16 years and was further educated in a professional school. An IQ evaluation at the age of 20 showed a score of 69. At his latest evaluation at the age of 29 years, his height was 164 cm, his weight was 85 kg, his BMI was 31 kg/m2, and the circumference of his head was 60 cm (90 centile). Other anthropometric measurements were thus: total upper limb length of 66 cm, upper arm length of 35 cm, forearm length of 25 cm, hand length of 15 cm, palm length of 8.5 cm, middle finger length of 6.5 cm, total lower limb length of 87 cm on the left and 86 cm on the right, thigh length of 42 cm on both sides, calf length of 45 cm on the left and 44 cm on the right, and feet length of 23 cm. The patient has minor facial anomalies (Fig. ), including flat face, sloping forehead with prominent supraorbital ridges, sparse and broad brows, depressed nasal ridge, short nose, long philtrum, and malar hypoplasia. Additionally, dental malocclusion, parodontosis, red and sparse scalp hair, male pattern baldness, and short neck are apparent. The patient is overweight and has limited elbow extension, brachydactyly of both hands, short rectangular nails, a single palmar crease, valgus deformation of the knees, brachydactyly of toes II\u2013V of both feet, short rectangular toenails, and relative hyperplasia of the halluces (Fig. ). The patient complained of premature tiredness, excessive perspiration, and poor fine motor function. He has primary arterial hypertension, and a cardiac ultrasound showed a mitral valve prolapse. An ophthalmological examination revealed hypermetropia. Hormonal screening was remarkable for elevated levels of serum PTH (13.9 pmol/l (n = 1.6\u20137.3 pmol/l)) and somatotropin (12.2 mIU/l (n < 9.0 mIU/l)). Elevated PTH levels were probably secondary to vit. D deficiency. TSH, T3, T4, FSH, LH, testosterone, cortisole and ACTH were within normal limits. 25-OH vitamin D was 51.4 nmol/l (n = 75\u2013100 nmol/l), serum calcium was 2.58 mmol/l (n = 2.10\u20132.55 mmol/l), serum phosphorus 0.82 mmol/l (n = 0.74\u20131.52 mmol/l), serum glucose was 6.09 mmol/l (n = 4.2\u20136.1 mmol/l). The glucose tolerance test was normal. The ultrasound of the thyroid gland and MRI scan of the hypophyseal gland showed no abnormalities. The X-ray of the hands showed very short and broad tubular bones. Metacarpals II\u2013V are proximally pointed. Coning of phalanges are present in the middle and proximal phalanges of the second to fifth fingers. There is relative sparing of the thumb. The metatarsal bones and phalanges are markedly shortened and there is disproportionate plumpness of the tubular bones of the hallux (Fig. ). Considering all clinical features and physical examination results, the diagnosis of acrodysostis type 2 was assigned for our proband.\nTo identify DNA sequence variants in the gene PDE4D and analyze segregation, Sanger sequencing was conducted for the proband and his parents. Phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol extraction method was used to isolate genomic DNA from peripheral blood of all three patients. The PDE4D exons 2, 3, 6, 7, 13, 15 were amplified by PCR with specific primers (designed using the Primer Blast software, NCBI, USA) and sequenced in the DNA sample of the proband. PDE4D exon 2 was amplified and sequenced in the parents\u2019 DNA samples to investigate inheritance pattern of the identified variant. Target PCR products from all three individuals were sequenced with BigDye\u00ae Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) and the capillary electrophoresis was carried out with ABI3130xl Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems, USA). Sanger sequencing results were analysed with Sequence Analysis v5.1 software (Applied Biosystems, USA). The reference sequence of the PDE4D gene (NCBI: NM_001104631.2) was used for aligning the obtained sequences. Primers and PCR conditions are available from the authors upon request. The pathogenicity of identified DNA sequence variant was evaluated by using several bioinformatics tools: SIFT (), PolyPhen-2 (), MutationTaster2 (), PROVEAN (). PDE4D nucleotide sequence conservation analysis was performed using multiple sequence alignment tool Clustal Omega (EMBL-EBI, ).\nHeterozygous missense variant NM_001104631.2:c.581G > C (NP_001098101.1:p.(Arg194Pro)) located in exon 2 of the gene PDE4D was detected in the proband\u2019s DNA sample by Sanger sequencing. Family segregation analysis of the identified variant revealed it\u2019s de novo occurrence. Different in silico tools predicted this variant to be likely pathogenic: SIFT damaging (0,00), PolyPhen-2 (0,99), MutationTaster2 disease causing (0,99), PROVEAN deleterious (\u2212 5,60).

He also complained of numbness and a tingling sensation on the left lateral side of the lower leg and dorsum of the foot. At the time of referral, the left leg and foot were soft and non-tender. Only the right dorsalis pedis was pulsatile, but not on the left side. Pain in the left lateral lower leg and dorsum of foot was scored 3/10 on the Numeric Pain Rating Scale. The Medical Research Council scale for weakness showed the following grades (right/left): hip extension 5/5, knee flexion 5/5, ankle dorsiflexion 5/1, and hallucis extension 5/1. He had no lower back pain and the straight leg raise reached 80\u00b0 on both sides. A positive Tinel's sign behind the fibular neck on the left side was noted. In a nerve conduction study, there was no compound motor action potential in the left deep peroneal nerve on the left extensor digitorum brevis or tibialis anterior muscle recordings, and no evoked sensory nerve action potential in the left superficial peroneal nerve (). Needle electromyography showed abnormal spontaneous activity at rest and no motor unit action potential activity in the left tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, and peroneus brevis muscles (). Computed tomography (CT) angiogram showed proximal occlusion of the left anterior tibial artery (ATA) () without any abnormal findings of the soft tissue. This led to a diagnosis of left common peroneal neuropathy due to occlusion of the left ATA. The patient was treated with oral warfarin.\nThe patient's medical history was reviewed. He did not have diabetes mellitus. He received a mitral valve replacement 5 years ago due to mitral stenosis, and echocardiography showed a moderate degree of aortic stenosis and regurgitation. In addition, he had complete atrioventricular block and valvular atrial fibrillation; and had a pacemaker inserted three years prior to referral. However, he had been prescribed only an antiplatelet agent because of a history of cerebellar intracranial hemorrhage 2 years previously.\nApproximately 4 weeks prior to referral, he visited another hospital suffering from chest pain, and received percutaneous coronary angiography which took about 30 minutes. After percutaneous coronary angiography, he received conservative care in a general ward, without any physical restrain or requirement for absolute bed rest. He could ambulate the ward with only minimal assistance. Some days later, he complained of left leg weakness and a brain CT was performed to rule out an acute brain lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was contraindicated because of the cardiac pacemaker. The brain CT showed a subacute ischemic lesion in the right posterior temporal region but it did not clinically correlate with the weakness. Although he complained of foot drop and paresthesia, there were no symptoms of anterior compartment syndrome such as tenderness, redness or swelling of low leg. No deep vein thrombosis or abnormal findings of soft tissues were found upon ultrasonography of the left leg. After improvement of the chest pain, he was discharged home. Two weeks later he was admitted to the cardiology department in the present hospital due to chest pain, and was referred to the rehabilitation department.

The patient also complained of general pruritus but no malaise, joint pain or muscle pain. Body temperature, respiration, and pulse were normal. His blood pressure was elevated at 182/94 mm Hg. His body height, body weight, and body mass index were 165 cm, 52 kg, and 19.1, respectively.\nOn physical examination, a firm, superficial, erythematous nodule measuring approximately 1 \u00d7 2 cm was noted within the lower, inner quadrant of the right breast. There was no nipple discharge, history of trauma, or cancer history. Given the possibility of breast carcinoma, the patient was admitted for further evaluation. Upon admission, initial laboratory results revealed: BUN, 40 mg/dl; creatinine, 28.63 mg/dl, C-reactive protein, 7.04 mg/L; hemoglobin, 6.3 g/dl; and a white blood count, 6700 /ml, with a left shift.\nChest X-ray upon admission showed increased patchy infiltrates bilaterally and a non-contrast chest CT was performed for further evaluation. The chest CT revealed diffuse patchy airspace consolidation and patchy pulmonary alveolar infiltrates with fine interstitial thickening over both lung fields, most severe within the left upper lobe and right lower lobe (Figure ). The primary diagnosis was atypical pneumonia. Differential diagnosis included asymmetric pulmonary edema and multifocal bronchoalveolar carcinoma.\nSputum culture, sputum cytology, serum mycoplasma antibody, and legionella antibody were performed. Azithromycin and augmentin were begun for possible atypical pneumonia. Sputum cytology was negative for malignant cells. Sputum culture, however, revealed Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella oxytoca (without tubercle bacillus). Appropriate antibiotic therapy was continued and repeat serial chest X-rays, performed during his hospital stay, showed resolution of the alveolar infiltrates, bilaterally.\nIncidentally noted on chest CT was a small oval nodular lesion measuring approximately 1.0 cm \u00d7 0.6 cm over the inferior and medial aspect of the right breast with infiltration within the subcutaneous adipose tissue (Figure ). As the nature of the breast nodule was unclear, a breast ultrasound (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) was recommended for further evaluation. Breast sonography revealed an oval, heterogeneous, predominantly hypoechoic nodule within the right breast measuring 1.35 cm \u00d7 0.39 cm in size between 3 and 4 o\u2019clock, 2 cm from the nipple, with a faint echogenic interface, partially indistinct margin, and increased blood flow signals on color Doppler (Figure ). Skin thickening and additional hypoechoic satellite nodules were noted in the surrounding area (Figure ). As this presentation was felt to be unusual in a male breast, breast malignancy was suspected. As the patient refused mammography or MRI, a sono-guided biopsy of the lesion was performed using an 18-gauge core biopsy needle (Figure ). Pathology from four strips tissue revealed fibroadipose tissue and hemorrhage with inflammatory cell infiltration. As the pathology was considered indeterminant, an excisional biopsy of the mass was performed. Pathology from the excisional biopsy confirmed breast panniculitis, consisting of fibroadipose tissue with prominent inflammation and fibrotic change in a vague perivascular pattern (Figure ). Hemorrhage and hemosiderin deposition were also present.

As no medical records were available, previous growth velocity could not be evaluated. The patient reported that he had always been short for his age throughout his childhood.\nHis recent medical history was negative for headaches, vomiting, or vision changes. There were no reports of fatigue, cold intolerance, constipation, and skin or hair changes. Appetite was normal with no recent weight loss. There were no academic concerns. He regularly played football, with no history of traumatic or nontraumatic fractures. He took no medications. For several months, he had reported minor bilateral symmetrical crookedness on his second fingers, without any pain or local symptoms.\nHe had been born at 36 gestational weeks, weighing 2450 g with no history of abnormal gestation, breech presentation, ischemic insult at birth, or other neonatal events.\nParental heights were normal, with a target height of 177.5 cm. Parental pubertal timing was also within normal limits. Family history was negative for short stature, endocrine, or autoimmune conditions.\nClinical examination revealed a dysmorphic, proportionate, and relatively short adolescent with normal vital signs. His anthropometric parameters were \u22122 SDs (standard deviations) for weight (37 kg) and between \u22122 SDs and \u22122.5 SDs for height (148 cm) (Belgian charts). His height was below his midparental genetic interval. His upper:lower segment ratio and arm span were normal. His hands and feet appeared short, with middle, painless tumefaction of soft tissue around the index proximal interphalangeal joints. No spinal abnormalities were noted, but a mild pectus excavatum was present. There was no thyromegaly. Testicular and pubic hair development was in Tanner stage II (testicular volume 6 ml). The most prominent dysmorphic features were a pear-shaped nose, a thin upper lip with small lower jaw, prominent ears, and markedly thin and sparse blonde hair with rarefaction of the lateral eyebrows (). The teeth examination was difficult because he wore dental braces to correct dental irregularities.\nAn extensive biological workup was performed. Complete blood count and serum levels of inflammatory markers, electrolytes, glucose, renal function, liver enzyme, and tissue transglutaminase antibody levels were normal. The laboratory findings showed normal thyroid and adrenal function and normal growth hormone secretion (normal levels of insulin-like growth factor and insulin-like growth factor binding protein). Additional pituitary and gonad testing revealed a normal prolactin level and pubertal testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels (). The bone age was evaluated at 12 years 6 months.\nA renal and cardiac ultrasound looking for other possible somatic malformations [] wasperformed and showed normal morphological kidneys, ureters, and urinary bladder and no cardiac abnormalities.\nAfter this first clinical, biological, and radiological evaluation, the working diagnosis was constitutional growth delay with late normal puberty, but skeletal dysplasia (dysmorphic features in the context of short stature) was considered for differential diagnosis.\nDuring the follow-up 6 months later, the initial apparent soft tissue tumefaction of his indexes had progressed to localized noninflammatory and painless deformity, causing limited difficulty in writing and typing on a keyboard. This sign was isolated, and the patient did not complain of pain or history of local trauma or infection. At this time, his clinical appearance was normal, except for the aforementioned dysmorphic traits. His growth velocity (5 cm/6 months) was normal in the context of spontaneous pubertal progress (Tanner stage III, testicular volume 8\u201310 ml).\nClinical examination of his hands revealed isolated ulnar deviation of the second fingers and symmetrical deformity of proximal interphalangeal joints of both hands (). He had no other painful or deformed joints.\nHis feet look normal, but the toes are short ().\nTheoretically, a differential diagnosis with inflammatory arthritis was considered, but the clinical findings (dysmorphic features, short stature, and relatively asymptomatic finger abnormalities) were more suggestive of a skeletal dysplasia. Radiographs of hands, feet, and pelvis were performed and allowed the definitive diagnosis.\nThe plain radiograph of his wrists showed cone-shaped epiphyses of the middle phalanges of the second digit of both hands with moderate deviation of the phalangeal axis (Figures and ).\nSimilar cone-shaped epiphyses were found in the proximal phalanx of the great toe and up to the fourth one of both feet with shortness of all toes ().\nNo other radiological joint impairments (juxtaarticular osteopenia or erosions) were found. Radiographs of the pelvis and whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (looking for fine abnormalities, particularly long bone cysts not visible on plain radiographs) [] were normal. The bone age was retarded at 12 years 6 months (the chronological age was 14 years 6 months).\nTaking together the clinical and particularly the radiological findings, the correct diagnosis of trichorhinophalangeal syndrome (TRPS) was achieved. This was a delayed diagnosis, and our explanations for this include the underrecognition of the dysmorphic features (in our first examination), the underinterpretation of fingers tumefaction in the clinical context, and consecutively no hand radiological exam being conducted.\nOther entities associating ectodermal and skeletal phenotypes were reviewed, particularly Albright osteodystrophy, acrodysostosis, and other brachydactyly syndromes, but several features of the presentation were inconsistent with these diagnoses.\nCytogenetic analysis was not performed. The family history appeared to be negative, his parents and his sister do not manifest the syndrome phenotype, and in such conditions, a sporadic case of TRPS type I was considered highly possible.", "Question": "What is the patient's body surface area?

The patient was taken to the PICU because her bradycardia and hypotension were resistant despite treatment. A central venous catheter was inserted quickly and 2500 ml/m2 hydration was started. In the laboratory analyses, complete blood count, renal function tests, serum electrolytes, and arterial blood gas analyses were taken, and all the results were within normal limits apart from elevated lactate levels (5.2 mml/L).

The first episode was a sudden onset of complete paralysis below distal thigh, and he had no other symptoms except leg paralysis. At a local clinic, physical examination revealed symmetric hyporeflexia in both lower extremities. Laboratory analysis revealed mild hypokalemia as below: Na+, 146 mmol/L; K+, 2.7 mmol/L; Cl-, 110 mmol/L; tCO2, 25 mmol/L without abnormality of blood gas analysis. Electrocardiogram showed only sinus tachycardia without atrioventricular block or prominent U wave. However, further evaluation for hypokalemia was not taken, even though there was a suggestion of hypokalemic paralysis, and the patient was just advised to eat an adequate dietary supplement of potassium rich food without any medication by the local clinic. After two weeks, a second episode of leg weakness occurred after morning meal. The muscle weakness was initially subtle but progressed in paralysis below knee and lasted for 6 hours. Thus, he was referred to our hospital. However, the patient visited our clinic the next day, when the paralysis had already subsided.\nThere was no past history or family history of neuromuscular disease and endocrinologic disease, except for his aunt's hypothyroidism. His appearance was reasonably healthy. His height was 168 cm, his weight was 60 kg, and his body mass index was 21.2 kg/m2. His blood pressure was 110/80 mmHg, his respiratory rate was 18 breaths/min, and his body temperature was 36.8\u2103. He had mild tachycardia with a heart rate of 100-110 beats/min,, but he had no palpitations. Neurological examination findings, including deep tendon reflex and cerebellar function test, were normal. The laboratory findings showed normal complete blood cell counts, normal electrolytes as below: Na+, 140 mmol/L; K+, 4.4 mmol/L; Cl-, 104 mmol/L; tCO2, 24 mmol/L. The laboratory findings also showed his normal liver, kidney and cardiac functions. His urine K+ excretion rate was normally low as 0.96 of urine K+/Cr ratio (range, 0-2). There were no abnormal laboratory findings to suggest adrenal hormone excess or primary hyperaldosteronism: adrenocorticotropic hormone, 40.11 pg/mL (range, 3.5-13.2 pg/mL); cortisol, 8.7 \u00b5g/dL (range, 5.0-23.0 \u00b5g/dL); 17 hydroxyprogesterone, 2.68 ng/mL (range, 0.6-3.42 ng/mL); aldosterone, 180.29 pg/mL (range, 38.9-306.8 pg/mL); renin, 6.13 ng/mL/hr (range, 1.31-3.95 ng/mL/hr); epinephrine, 0.030 ng/mL (range, 0-0.30 ng/mL); norepinephrine, 0.087 ng/mL (range, 0-0.80 ng/mL). Thyroid function test (TFT) revealed a hyperthyroidism: serum free thyroxine (fT4), 2.10 ng/dL (range, 0.70-1.48 ng/dL); triiodothyronine (T3), 2.95 ng/mL (range, 0.58-1.59 ng/mL); thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), <0.025 mU/L (range, 0.35-4.94 mU/L). Thus, he was diagnosed as having hypokalemic paralysis due to hyperthyroidim. Serum TSH receptor antibodies were high at 6.05 IU/L (range, 0-1.75 IU/L), thyroid stimulating antibody was positive, and thyroid ultrasonography revealed diffuse enlarged thyroid and increased vascularity. These findings were consistent with Graves' disease as etiology of his hyperthyroidism. He was initially treated with lower dose of an antithyroid drug (methimazole 5 mg once daily) than usual, since his thyrotoxic symptoms and signs were absent, and his level of serum fT4 was not prominent. In addition, a \u03b2-adrenergic blocker (propranolol) was simultaneously used for preventing the paralysis. After two weeks, a follow-up TFT revealed aggravated hyperthyroidism, and he was treated with increased dose of antithyroid drugs. After two months, since his heart rate and blood pressure were stable and he had no symptoms of palpitations, \u03b2-blockers were discontinued successfully.

There were no medical events or endocrine diseases in his own or familial medical history. Informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case.\nPhysical examination revealed a plethoric moon-shaped face and central obesity, without purple striae or a buffalo hump. The blood pressure was 150/90 mm Hg, and the patient\u2019s height, body weight, and waist circumference were 187 cm, 90 kg, and 104 cm, respectively (body mass index 25.74 kg/m2).\nThe results of routine laboratory tests including liver and kidney function tests were normal. The fasting plasma glucose level of 6.5 mmol/L [reference interval (RI): 3.7\u20135.6 mmol/L] and glycosylated hemoglobin level of 44 mmol/mol (RI: 20\u201342 mmol/mol) were consistent with new-onset impaired fasting glucose. A sodium level of 146 mmol/L (RI: 136\u2013145 mmol/L) and potassium level of 3.5 mmol/L (RI: 3.4\u20134.5 mmol/L) suggested increased mineralocorticoid activity.\nAfter exclusion of exogenous steroids, first-line screening tests for suspected endogenous hypercortisolism were performed. The 24 hours urinary free cortisol excretion level was elevated (6.465\u20135.375 nmol/24 hours; RI: 16\u2013168 nmol/24 hours), the salivary cortisol rhythm was impaired (late-night salivary cortisol level of 55\u201346 nmol/L; RI: 0.5\u20132.6 nmol/L), and serum cortisol level was not suppressed after administration of 1 mg dexamethasone (cortisol 444 nmol/L). These results confirmed a diagnosis of endogenous CS. ACTH levels were increased (14.1 pmol/L; RI: 2.2\u201311 pmol/L), indicating ACTH-dependent CS.\nOver the next few weeks, hypokalemia was observed along with increased blood pressure levels. Therefore, we initiated medical therapy with potassium canrenoate and metyrapone, which achieved rapid control of blood pressure and potassium levels.\nTo identify the source of ACTH secretion, the patient underwent all second-line dynamic tests for ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism.\nAfter the human CRH test (100 \u03bcg), there was a significant increase in both ACTH level (15.2 to 50.6 pmol/L, +233.3%) and cortisol level (763 to 1.631 nmol/L, +113.8%). There was also a significant increase in both ACTH level (16.8 to 27.7 pg/mL, +64.7%) and cortisol level (778 to 1,032 nmol/L, +32%) during the DDAVP test. These results suggested pituitary ACTH secretion (). However, no cortisol suppression was found after the HDDST (8 mg overnight, cortisol level 778 to 690 nmol/L, \u221211.3%).\nPituitary MRI revealed a 4-mm pituitary microadenoma; however, the clinical features, in particular the rapid onset of severe hypertension and hypokalemia, combined with reduced cortisol suppression after the HDDST, suggested EAS. Therefore, the patient underwent chest CT and abdominal enhanced MRI, which showed multiple pancreatic nodules; their neuroendocrine origin was suggested by the uptake of 68-Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT, confirming the presence of somatostatin receptors.\nConsidering the discordant responses to second-line dynamic tests and evidence of both pituitary and pancreatic lesions, we decided to perform BIPSS to facilitate the differential diagnosis between CD and EAS. The central IPS to peripheral (P) ACTH ratio (IPS:P =25) after CRH administration confirmed the pituitary origin of ACTH secretion.\nBased on the clinical presentation (pituitary adenoma and pancreatic nodules in a young patient), we performed Sanger sequencing for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), which confirmed a pathogenic variant in the menin gene (base pair insertions c.188_189TT cDNA692_693_inTT Q64Sfs56, loss of frameshift).\nThe patient underwent pituitary surgery, and histological examination confirmed a pituitary adenoma with positive ACTH staining.

An ankle arthroscopy was conducted, and we found a few gouty tophus deposits in the talus articular cartilage and synovial tissue. The medial, central talus articular cartilage was soft, uneven and partially defective, with gouty tophus deposits. A 1.5-mm K-wire was drilled into this site to confirm the talus lesion site under C-arm fluoroscopy. A medial curved incision was made on the medial malleolus and the talus osteochondral lesion was exposed after inverted V-shaped medial malleolus osteotomy and removed with trephine; the removed lesions were found to be gouty tophus (Fig. ), which was further confirmed by the finding of monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU) crystals in postoperative histological sections (Fig. ). After complete debridement of these lesions, the lesion site was not a regular shape, and a very small amount of normal osteochondral tissue was cut with a small osteotome to form a square lesion site. Then an osteochondral block of the same size was harvested from the autologous talus neck and grafted onto the site and fixed with two 2.0 mm bioabsorbable screws. The donor site was filled and tamped with the cancellous bone on the osteotomy surface of the medial malleolus. Then the medial malleolus was fixed with three cannulated screws after reduction. Aceclofenac dispersible tablets and allopurinol were taken by the patient immediately after the operation and he was advised to use his left ankle passively, with no weight-bearing for 5 weeks. At this time his serum uric acid concentration was in the normal range and a good medial malleolus union was revealed by X-ray imaging. Partial weight-bearing was encouraged 2 months postoperatively when the cyst talus osteochondral lesion had disappeared and was replaced with normal bone tissue 6 months postoperatively. The patient could walk with slight pain at this time with a VAS score of 1 and was very satisfied with the outcome. Regular monitoring of serum uric acid concentrations and his modified diet continued, and he has been followed up for 12 months.", "Question": "What is the patient's body surface area?

He was recruited for the study in a tertiary outpatient clinical center specializing in conservative treatment of spinal disorders. The patient presented two primary curves, a right thoracic curve (60\u00b0 Cobb angle) and left lumbar curve (63\u00b0 Cobb angle) (). He was 170 cm and 70 kg (Body Mass Index (BMI): 24.22; Tri-Ponderal Mass Index (TMI) []: 14.25). Aesthetic impairment was observed as he obtained a score of 51.1 at the TRACE test in the recently developed Rasch version [] (). Radiological parameters of the curves, both in brace and out brace, are described in . In-brace spine x-ray is shown in .\nThe patient had come to our attention with a prescription of a rigid brace (Lyonese) 23 hours per day; nevertheless, self-reported compliance was just 8 to 10 hours per day. Because of the severity of the curves that well exceeded threshold for surgery consideration (63\u00b0), surgical treatment was advised; however, the patient refused surgery. For this reason, a very rigid brace (Sforzesco) was prescribed 23 hours per day. A thermic sensor was applied (Thermobrace) in order to objectively verify compliance [].\n: The present case report adheres to the CARE (CAse REporting) structure and reporting Guidelines []. The present study is a case study with a prospective observational design. Additional and non-invasive procedures have been used, i.e. actigraphy. The subject\u2019s rest-activity data were recorded for one consecutive week, at home, through an accelerometer, in the last week of July 2018; that period of the season was the holiday period for the subject, with no school commitments. The period coincided with the first days of Sforzesco brace wear 23 hours per day. The study protocol was conducted in accordance with the current national and international laws and regulations governing the use of human subjects (Declaration of Helsinki II). The subject, before the beginning of the study, signed an informed consent that explained the study protocol highlighting its benefits and possible risks.\n: Actigraphy is widely used to study insomnia, sleep and rest-activity circadian rhythms disorders [,]; it represents a valid and practical tool that is extremely less invasive than the traditional polysomnography (PSG). An actigraph recording can be performed at home without hospitalization, lasting for many consecutive weeks []. It was also shown that the circadian period of the actigraph-defined sleep/wake rhythm accurately predicted the period of the PSG-defined activity-rest cycle [].\nRAR was recorded using an the Actiwatch 2 actigraph (Philips Respironics, OR, USA). The device is composed by a piezoelectric triaxial accelerometer able to convert axial movements over time in electrical signals. The subject\u2019s activity counts (AC) were recorded 24 hours/day for one week, i.e. seven consecutive days, from Monday to Sunday. The ACs data were transferred from actigraph to a PC with the use of the Philips Actiware 6 Software (Philips Respironics, OR, USA) and then exported and analyzed, epoch per epoch (1 epoch = 60 seconds), in an Excel working sheet (Microsoft Corporation, WA, USA) before performing the rhythmometric analysis (see statistical analysis for details).\n: To determine the existence of RAR for each single day and for the week of monitoring, the ACs were analyzed using the single and the population mean cosinor method respectively [,]. Both methods studies the cosine mathematical function that best fits the data as a function of time and they describe three specific rhythmometric parameters: MESOR, the Midline Estimating Statistic of Rhythm; A, the amplitude; and \u03a6, the acrophase. The MESOR is a rhythm-adjusted mean for a 24-h period, A is the measure of one half the extent of the rhythmic variation in a cycle, and \u03a6 indicates the time interval within which the highest values are observed. The three parameters are reported with the relevant 95% confidence intervals (CI) (). The statistical rhythmometric analyses were carried out using the Time Series Analysis Serial Cosinor 6.3 (Expert Soft Technology, Richelieu, France). Significance was set at p < 0.05.\n: In parallel with RAR monitoring, sleep parameters were also objectively monitored for seven consecutive nights with the same actigraph (Philips Respironics, OR, USA). The Actiwatch 2 is a widely used actigraph worn on the non-dominant wrist that has the capability to determine both RARs but also sleep parameters [] and it has been validated against PSG in healthy children and adults []. It is however important to underline that sleep parameters can be derived from Actiwatch 2 recordings using three different threshold settings (low, medium, or high) for detection of movements. The threshold settings use different magnitudes of activity for discriminating sleep and wake states, and thus affect the sleep parameters derived from the actigraph. Therefore, in the present case study, a low actigraphic sensitivity threshold (80 counts per epoch) was selected since this cut-off value seems to provide the best combination of sensitivity and specificity in young subjects [,].\nTen sleep parameters were measured:\nI) Sleep Start (SS): the start of sleep was derived automatically using the Actiwatch 2 algorithm; it is expressed in hours and minutes (hh:mm);\nII) Sleep End (SEnd): the end of sleep was derived automatically using the Sleepwatch algorithm; it is expressed in hours and minutes (hh:mm);\nIII) Time in Bed (TB): the difference between SS and Send, expressed in minutes;\nIV) Sleep Latency (SL): the period of time, in minutes, between bedtime and sleep onset time;\nV) Sleep Efficiency (SE): the percentage of time in bed actually spent sleeping;\nVI) Wake After Sleep Onset (WASO), the amount of time spent awake after sleep has been initiated; WASO is typically expressed in minutes;\nVII) Total Sleep Time (TST), the amount of sleep, expressed both in minutes and percentage, obtained during a sleep period;\nVIII) Immobility Time (IT), the total time, expressed both in percentage and minutes, spent without recording any movement during time in bed;\nIX) Mobility Time (MT), the total time, expressed both in percentage and minutes, spent recording significant movement during time in bed;\nX) Fragmentation Index (FI), the sum of the percentages of mobility and immobility accesses in one minute, divided by the number of immobility accesses. FI is expressed in percentage.\nThe data are reported as mean\u00b1SD. Together with the actigraph, the study subject received a sleep diary to record bed time, wake up time, the number of nocturnal awakenings, or the time spent without wearing the device.\n: The sensor applied showed a very good compliance to treatment in the period analyzed with an objectively reported compliance of 22.8 hours per day.\n: The single cosinor method revealed the presence of a statistically significant RAR for each single day (p < 0.001). Similarly, the population mean cosinor applied to total data of the seven days of monitoring, revealed the presence of a significant RAR (p < 0.001); specifically: the percentage of rhythm was 23.4%, the mean MESOR was 84.6 ACs, the amplitude registered a mean value of 74.4 ACs and the acrophase occurred at 17:56 h. reports the rhythmometric parameters of RAR and shows graphically the rhythm.\n: and report both the raw data and the mean\u00b1SD of all sleep parameters. The subject showed a large variability in all ten parameters with a large gap between minimum and maximum values. For instance: SL ranged from 0 to 89 minutes with a mean value of 25.9 \u00b1 35.9 minutes and, similarly, FI ranged from 11.3% to 43.2% with a mean value of 27.3 \u00b1 12.8%. In general, the subject reached a good sleep quantity: 507.9 \u00b1 30.2 minutes of TB with a mean TST of 450.7 \u00b1 20.1 minutes, corresponding to the 88.9 \u00b1 4.3% of time spent sleeping; on the contrary, as expected, sleep quality, although not bad, was not excellent: SE was equal to 83.3 \u00b1 7.2%, mean WASO value was 57.1 \u00b1 24.6 minute, and IT registered a mean value of 86.3 \u00b1 4.4%. It is also important to note that sleep timing, i.e. SS and SEnd, showed an expected marked delay: on average, the subject started to sleep at 01:36 \u00b1 01:02 h and woke up at 09:55 \u00b1 00:40 h.", "Question": "What is the patient's body surface area?

There was no loss of power in all four limbs, 4/5 in both the upper limbs, and 4/5 in both the lower limbs as per Medical Research Council (MRC) rating. His sensory system, other cranial nerves, brain-stem function appeared normal. His other systems were within the normal limit. His vitals were also within the normal limit (pulse rate: 70/ min, regular; blood pressure: 124/76 mm Hg, respiratory rate: 14/ min). Laboratory investigations (routine hematological; liver and kidney function tests; serum electrolytes; coagulation profile), chest X-ray, electrocardiogram (ECG) were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging of brain showed gross subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) but no focal lesion of parenchyma or any midline shift []. Cerebral angiography revealed an anterior communicating artery aneurysm, which was thought to be the cause of SAH and IVH. According to Hunt and Hess classification, he was considered grade II. The patient was posted for clipping of anterior communicating artery aneurysm through the pterion (right) approach. An informed consent was taken for surgery, anesthesia, and postoperative care in ICU.\nThe patient was premedicated with tablet alprazolam 0.5 mg orally at the night before operation. On the day of surgery, after establishing intravenous (IV) line with 18G cannula, the patient received injection (Inj) midazolam 2 mg, Inj ondansetron 6 mg, and Inj glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg. General anesthesia was induced by Inj fentanyl (2 \u03bcg/ kg) and thiopentone (5 mg/kg) following preoxygenetion and intubation was done with size 8.5 flexometallic endotracheal tube (Sheridan/SPIRAL-FLEX\u00ae, Hudson RCI) using Inj rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg). Anesthesia was maintained with O2:N2O (40:60), propofol (infusion at 100-150 \u03bcg/kg/min) and intermittent bolus of Inj vecuronium and Inj fentanyl. Mannitol (1 g/kg) was infused to provide optimum brain relaxation. For invasive monitoring, central venous catheter was placed via the right subclavian vein and intra-arterial catheter was placed at left radial artery. Intraoperative monitoring included five lead ECG, invasive blood pressure, SpO2, end tidal carbon dioxide, central venous pressure, urine output, core temperature, bi-spectral index, and neuromuscular monitoring. Keyhole-type craniotomy was done and surgery proceeded uneventfully in the supine position and haemodynamics remained stable throughout the operative period, which lasted for 6 h. N2O was discontinued before dural closure. At the end of the surgery, neuromuscular blockade was reversed when the TOF ratio was 40% with 0.5 mg Inj glycopyrrolate and 2.5 mg neostigmine. The trachea was extubated once the TOF ratio was 90%, respiratory effort was adequate, and patient was obeying commands. He was shifted to the postoperative recovery room.\nOne hour after surgery, the patient developed sudden generalized convulsions, a rapid deterioration in the consciousness level, with dilatation of the left pupil. The airway was secured with Gudel's airway (number 5) and Inj midazolam 4 mg was given to control the convulsions. He maintained an oxygen saturation of 97-99% with 3L oxygen through the facemask. His arterial blood pressure and pulse rate were 120/70 mmHg and 92/ min, respectively. An immediate computed tomography (CT) scan of brain done postoperatively, revealed accumulation of air in the bi-frontal subdural space compressing mainly the right sylvian fissure and right lateral ventricle without any apparent midline shift (mount Fuji sign []), indicating a diagnosis of tension pneumocephalus. The patient was taken to the operation theatre immediately for aspiration of pneumocephalus through a frontal drill hole and air came out under pressure.

He also had thyroid nodules, and thyroid functional tests showed normal FT3 (7.41, normal 3.6\u20137.5 pmol/L), FT4 (21.56, normal 12\u201322 pmol/L), and increased TSH (24.79, normal 0.27\u20134.2 \u03bcIU/mL). He ignored the test result, because of the normal concentration of FT3 and FT4. Four years ago the patient got married and was referred to our hospital because of sterility. At this time, the hormonal examination implied central hypogonadism with serum levels of 1.6 mIU/mL FSH (RR, 1.5\u201312.4), LH 1.0 mIU/mL (RR, 1.7\u20138.6), E2 <5 pg/mL (RR, 7.63\u201342.8), and T <0.03 ng/mL (RR 2.49\u20138.3). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the sella region was therefore performed, revealing a pituitary tumor measuring 4.3 \u00d7 4.1 \u00d7 3.0 cm in the sella, involving cavernous sinuses and extending inferior to the sphenoid sinus and third ventricle (Fig. ). He was referred to our multidisciplinary team of pituitary disease and transferred to department of neurosurgery. On physical examination at admission, the patient was 168.0 cm tall and weighed 59.0 kg with a body mass index (BMI) of 20.9 kg/m2. The patient's char-acteristics were as follows: temperature, 36.2 \u00b0C; pulse, 56 beat/min; blood pressure, 94/64 mmHg; respiratory rate, 20 breath/min. The patient presented with blurred vision. The TgAb and TPOAb were positive. The thyroid gland was diffusely enlarged and ultrasonography of the thyroid revealed a multinodular gland with a moderate parenchymal heterogeneity suggesting Hashimoto thyroiditis. The laboratory hormone examination showed hypopituitarism (Table ). The computer perimetry suggested a defective visual field. Based on these data, we diagnosed the patient with TSH-producing pituitary macroadenoma, hypopituitary, and Hashimoto thyroiditis. Two weeks after diagnosis, total resection of the pituitary macroadenoma was performed through trans-sphenoidal neurosurgery in September 2014. Upon immunohistochemical examination, the resected pituitary adenoma cells exhibited positive staining with the TSH and PRL antibody, and the percentage of positive Ki-67 was <2%, suggesting that the tumor was benign (Fig. ). After the operation, TSH and thyroid hormone rapidly decreased to a normal range. However, the concentration of ACTH, cortisol, LH, FSH, and testosterone were still extremely low.

The patient had never been diagnosed with a medical problem and had no previous history of fracture. Clinical examination revealed that the patient was slightly short in height (153.4 cm) and moderately overweight (62.4 kg, body mass index [BMI] 26.52 kg/m2). Examination of her facial features revealed a long lower face with vertical maxillary excess and mandibular asymmetry with occlusal canting of the maxilla. In addition, she had upper lip protrusion and lip incompetence.(, ) The intraoral findings included Class III malocclusion with an open bite. She had normal tooth structure and received proper dental care. Therefore, her periodontal health and oral hygiene were good.\nAfter the initial interview, the patient was referred to an orthodontist for leveling and alignment of the teeth, and treatment continued for approximately one year. After the presurgical orthodontic treatment, a clinical evaluation was repeated, and cephalometric radiographs and face bow recordings were obtained for final surgical planning 4 weeks prior to the surgery.\nIn addition, a work-up for general anesthesia and surgery was performed, and the preoperative hematologic examination, electrocardiogram and chest radiograph were unremarkable.\nThe surgery included bimaxillary procedures. Le Fort I osteotomy with midline correction, canting correction, posterior impaction, and setback movement of the maxilla were performed via rigid skeletal fixation. Bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomies were performed with a setback movement via the hybrid fixation technique (with one miniplate and one additional bicortical screw). On the left side, a greenstick fracture occurred in the proximal segment. However, we could appropriately position the proximal and distal segments as planned, and so two additional bicortical screws were used to fix the fractured proximal segment. Two closed suction drains were inserted into the mandibular surgical site. The operation was completed without major bleeding, and the estimated blood loss during the surgery was 200 mL.\nAbnormal edema and ecchymosis were observed from the second postoperative day.() At first, an improperly functioning closed suction drain was suspected, but the ecchymosis and edema appeared to be bilateral, decreasing the likelihood of drain malfunction. On the second postoperative day, drain removal and maxilla-mandibular fixation (MMF) with elastic ring were routinely performed. Normally, an orthognathic surgical patient is hospitalized for 2 nights and 3 days after surgery, but in this case, the discharge was delayed due to the appearance of abnormal ecchymosis and edema. On the fifth postoperative day, nasal bleeding and transient blood pressure lowering were noted, but the problems resolved after nasal packing and administration of intravenous fluids. At 6 days postoperatively, the patient was stable, and she was discharged from the hospital.\nMMF was routinely stopped 2 weeks after surgery, and training elastics were applied. No other complications were observed. However, the ecchymosis persisted for 6 weeks, and although it dissipated slowly and spontaneously, no specific treatment was needed for its resolution. The follow-up examination at postoperative 3 months showed uneventful healing.\nDuring the search for the cause of unexpected postoperative bleeding, she recounted multiple fractures of the lower limbs during childhood, and blue sclera was noticed. Furthermore, her familial history included multiple bone fractures in her mother, grandmother, and cousin. Therefore, OI type I was suspected, and it was inferred that the patient's complications were ultimately caused by bleeding due to vessel fragility from OI.\nThe postsurgical orthodontic treatment began one month after surgery. The molar and canine relation became Class I, and the open bite was greatly improved. After approximately eight months, debonding was done. The long lower face with vertical maxillary excess and mandibular asymmetry with occlusal canting of the maxilla were greatly improved.

An emergent brain CT demonstrated acute traumatic subdural hematoma, thus an emergent decompressive craniectomy and hematoma removal was performed under general anesthesia without any remarkable incidences. After the first operation, the patient had not made favorable progresses, therefore several further operations such as brain abscess drainage, external ventricular drainage catheter insertion, cerebral lobectomy, ventriculoperitoneal shunt were performed during a 4 month period. Finally, the patient had cranioplasty.\nThe vital signs of the patient scheduled for cranioplasty were a systolic/diastolic blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg, heart rate 104 bpm, respiratory rate via tracheostomy 20 /min and the patient was still in a stuporous state. Preoperative laboratory data were within the normal range, and the chest X-ray revealed improvement of focal pneumonia and an arterial blood gas analysis in the tolerable range (ABGA; pH 7.418/PaCO2 39.5 mmHg/PaO2 104 mmHg with 2 L/min oxygen inhalation). An electrocardiogram (ECG) performed before the surgery showed sinus tachycardia, and transthoracic echocardiography revealed a preserved global left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction; 69%). The preoperative brain CT sacn showed a marked shrinkage of the left cerebral hemisphere and an increase in ventricular size (). The general anesthesia was induced with 125 mg thiopental sodium and 50 mg rocuronium, without any premedication. The vital signs were monitored using noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), ECG and a pulse oximeter. The tracheostomy tube was changed for a 7.5 mm cuffed tracheostomy tube. Following the induction of anesthesia, the right dorsalis pedis artery was cannulated with a 22 gauge catheter, and the right femoral vein was cannulated with an 18 gauge catheter. General anesthesia was maintained with balanced anesthesia using oxygen-air-sevoflurane (0.5\u20131.5%) and supplementary remifentanil (4\u20136 \u00b5g/kg/h) infusion. Cranioplasty was carried out under controlled ventilation, keeping within 10% fluctuation of the vital signs and ETCO2 with intermittent injections of ephedrine, phenylephrine and esmolol.

There was no pallor or edema feet and no signs of heart failure. His resting heart rate (HR) was 70/min and blood pressure measured 130/80 mmHg.\nMost of his preoperative blood investigations including coagulation profile were within normal limits except random blood sugar which was 164 mg/dl. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed Q waves in leads II, III and aVF and ST segment depression in leads V1 -V6. The preoperative chest X-ray was normal. Two-dimensional echo done on admission revealed akinetic inferior and mid-posterior wall; hypokinetic basal, posterior wall, mid and distal interventricular septum; mildly dilated LV and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <25%.\nTwo months ago, a detailed cardiac work up of the patient had been done wherein a coronary angiogram revealed anomalous origin of the LAD from RCA and absent left main coronary artery (). Thallium scan also showed LVEF of 25% at rest tomography angiography showed a common ostium for RCA and LAD ().\nChronic total occlusion of RCA (after giving off LAD) as well as a short, narrowed out left circumflex (LCx) artery resulted in complete loss of viable myocardium in their corresponding territories. Thus, the myocardium had its blood supply from LAD and partly from LCx artery.\nThe patient was on medical management as coronary revascularization could not be considered owing to the semi-emergent nature of surgery and that most of the myocardium was already compromised. The patient's relatives were initially reluctant to give their consent for the procedure, thereby causing delay in surgical intervention. Until then, the patient was managed conservatively on continuous Ryle's tube aspiration, intravenous fluids and antibiotics.\nAll the prescribed medications were continued preoperatively except aspirin and clopidogrel, which were stopped at admission. Low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin 60 mg subcutaneously twice daily) was started. It was discontinued 24 hours prior to surgery. The patient was hemodynamically stable and co-operative. Therefore, sequential epidural combined with local infiltration of the surgical site with 0.25% bupivacaine was selected as the anesthetic technique. Central venous pressure (CVP), arterial blood pressure (ABP), blood gas analysis and continuous cardiac output (CO) monitoring (Edwards Life sciences FloTrac monitor) were used along with routine monitors. The baseline ABP, HR, CVP, CO were 122/72 mmHg, 90/min, 7 mmHg and 7 L/min respectively. An epidural catheter was inserted in T10 -T11 interspace with the patient in sitting position. This provided sufficient analgesia and motor blockade for surgery. The surgical site was also infiltrated with 10 ml of 2% lignocaine. The patient was on spontaneous ventilation with tittrated mild sedation with fentanyl and midazolam. Total fluid administered was 1.5 L (1 L of normal saline; 500 ml of colloid). It was guided by CVP, stroke volume (SV), stroke volume variation (SVV) and CO on the Edwards Sciences FloTrac Vigileo monitor. The patient remained hemodynamically stable until about 50 min of the start of surgery when ABP was 86/54 (65mmHg) and CO was 3 L/min probably due to last epidural bolus of bupivacaine. This was not accompanied by any ECG changes. CVP remained normal. Blood loss was minimal. Ionotropic support (nor-adrenaline 0.07 \u03bcg/kg/min) was then started. Thereafter, ABP stabilized and serial ABG's done during surgery were normal. The surgical procedure included resection of gangrenous segment of bowel, anastomosis and anatomical repair of hernia, which lasted approximately 2 h.\nPostoperatively, 12 lead ECG was done, which showed no fresh changes. Trop-T done after 12 h of surgery was also negative. Intensive monitoring (ABP, CVP, ECG, and CO) was continued for 48 h postoperatively. The ionotropic support was tapered and discontinued after 36 h of surgery to maintain a mean ABP of 75-80 mm Hg. Analgesia was maintained with epidural infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine with100 mcg fentanyl in 50 ml of normal saline titrated to effect and hemodynamics, intravenous analgesics (diclofenac 75 mg 8 hourly and tramadol whenever required).

The patient had taken mesalazine 3,000 mg/day and azathioprine 50 mg/day and had started infliximab one year prior to admission. With infliximab, the patient experienced immediate relief of diarrhea and abdominal pain, but obstructive symptoms had gradually worsened. He complained of abdominal pain, increased borborygmus, decreased oral intake, and a decrease in body weight. Abdominal CT scan and small bowel series revealed an ileocolic fistula, multiple ulcers, and severe stricture of the small bowel (). Vital signs (blood pressure, 120/80 mmHg; pulse rate, 80 beats/min; respiratory rate, 20 beats/min; body temperature, 36.9\u2103) were normal. He has a height of 171 cm, a weight of 53 kg, and a BMI of 18.1 kg/m2. The patient had a chronically ill appearance with pale conjunctiva, mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, and accentuated bowel sounds. Liver and spleen were not palpable. Pitting edema could be seen on both lower limbs. Laboratory testing revealed anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.7 g/dL, leukocyte count of 3,970/mm3, and platelet count of 265,000/mm3.

ESR and CRP level were 35 mm/h and 2.1 mg/dL, respectively. Both anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae-antibodies IgA and IgG were negative, and the patient's CDAI was about 261 points. He had been experiencing approximately 25 liquid stools per week, severe abdominal pain, and a very poor sense of well-being. To improve the patient's condition, wide resection of involved bowel and colostomy would be needed; however, because of a psychological reaction to personal disfigurement and the need to relearn bowel habits, he strongly refused colostomy. Therefore, we decided to perform a small and large bowel segmental resection and primary repair.\nGross findings during surgery included an abscess connected to the terminal ileum, bladder adhesion, a jejuno-sigmoid fistula, and huge inflammatory masses. An ileocecectomy, jejunal resection, and sigmoid colon resection were performed, followed by primary repair of the jejunum, rectum, and sigmoid colon (). Fortunately, 220 cm of the small bowel remained after surgery. However, one week postoperatively, the patient developed a high fever and abdominal pain. Abdominal CT scan revealed a fistula connected to an intraperitoneal abscess (). The patient was started on intravenous antibiotics, and the abscess was drained percutaneously. A total of four percutaneous drainages were performed. The drainage fluid was dark yellow and highly viscous but gradually cleared after continuous use of antibiotics. However, despite no further evidence of infection (white blood cell count 4,270/mm3 and CRP 0.3 mg/dL), approximately 30-50 cc of fluid issued from every drain daily, even one month after the operation.\nThe patient was started on 5 mg/kg of infliximab to treat the postoperative fistula and prevent a recurrence. After infliximab therapy was initiated, drainage decreased dramatically to less than 10 cc a day. In follow-up abdominal CT scans, the abscess in the abdominal cavity and the postoperative fistula disappeared (). The percutaneous drainages were consecutively removed, the patient began receiving oral nutrition, and the intravenous antibiotics were stopped. The patient quit smoking, and infliximab was injected to prevent disease recurrence. Three months after surgery, the patient looked healthy and reported passing stools once or twice a day.

The patient fell about two meters down an embankment one hour before the presentation and was unable to stand up due to pain, so he was brought to our hospital by ambulance.\nClinical examination revealed a marked bilateral swelling of both knees, severe pain at the passive mobilization of the knee joints, pain-limiting active flexion to less than 30\u00b0, and an inability to actively extend the knee joints or to perform an active straight leg raise bilaterally. Additionally, weight-bearing had hardly been possible. There was a loss of fullness and a palpable deficit at the inferior poles of his patellae. Testing of the ligamentous knee joint stabilizers was significantly limited by guarding due to the severe sharp pain. The patient's medical history revealed that a couple of years earlier, he had a right knee sprain resulting in an acute rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), which was treated conservatively. The patient does not take any drugs regularly, and we note that he is allergic to levofloxacin. The weight and height of the patient were recorded at the physical examination as 107 kilograms and 180 cm, with a body mass index (BMI) of 33.\nPlain radiographs of his knees showed bilateral knee effusions with patella alta (high-riding patellae) on both anteroposterior and lateral views. Insall-Salvati ratios measured 1.6 and 1.47 for right and left knee, respectively () (normal values range from 0.8 to 1.2; patella alta > 1.2 and patella baja < 0.8). Moreover, the irregularity and incongruity of the patellar tendons on the lateral radiographs were additional signs suggestive of the extensor mechanism's rupture and consistent with the tendons' rupture from the lower pole of the patellae bilaterally.\nOur patient was operated under general anesthesia 48 hours after the accident. He was placed in the supine position. The clinical examination under anesthesia of both knees demonstrated a full instability of the MCL with a valgus stress test at both 0 and 30\u00b0 of knee flexion. No laxity was demonstrated in the remaining ligaments of the knee joint. The lower extremities were prepared and draped together in the usual sterile fashion. The intervention was performed without the use of a tourniquet.\nOur ligamentous reconstruction was approached by an anterior longitudinal midline incision. Dissection was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissues to the level of the patellar and quadriceps paratenon, which were carefully preserved. The patellar tendon rupture was identified near the proximal osteotendinous junction bilaterally (). The hemarthrosis was evacuated, and the joint was copiously irrigated. A chronic tear of the right ACL was identified, with the proximal portion of the ligament missing and only scar tissue remaining with the ACL stump adhering to an intact Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL). A complete proximal (femoral) MCL tear was identified bilaterally, confirming our clinical suspicion. The medial and lateral retinacula, which were involved as well, were identified for later repair.\nAt first, with the same incision, the MCL tear was approached. Proximal reinsertion at the level of the medial femoral condyle using a DePuy Mitek super QuickAnchor\u2122 Plus DS\u00ae was done to ensure the stability of the medial motion plane. Then, after debridement of the tendinous tissue and visualization of the inferior pole of the patella, three DePuy Mitek super QuickAnchor\u2122 Plus DS\u00ae were screwed into the medial, middle, and lateral thirds of the patella in the proper coronal plane. The purchase of the anchors was tested as we were able to deliver the patella to the distal extent of the incision by pulling on the anchor sutures. Then, a circumferential 1.2 mm thick stainless steel wire was passed through the center of the thickness of the patella superiorly and the tibial tuberosity inferiorly. Gradual tension was applied on the metallic wire to obtain the optimal patellar height, confirmed by an intraoperative lateral X-ray. One suture in each anchor was used to create a running Krackow stitch distally through the tendon, ensuring that full-thickness bites were obtained.\nThe second limb of each suture was passed in a locked fashion through the proximal free tendon and tied within the substance of the tendon. The additional suture within each anchor was incorporated into the repair for reinforcement in a simple continuous fashion. The reconstruction was further protected by a strip of quadriceps tendon measuring 10 \u00d7 1 cm, long enough to cover the patellar tendon, which was harvested and turned down. The edges of the turned down quadriceps tendon were fixed to the underlying patellar tendon using slowly absorbable interrupted sutures (Vicryl 2.0). Next, the medial and lateral retinacula tears were repaired using interrupted No. 2 PDS sutures (Ethicon; Somerville, New Jersey, USA). The strength of the repair was tested bilaterally through a gentle range of motion; a flexion up to 130\u00b0 was possible.\nPostoperatively, the legs were placed in knee immobilizer braces, with the knees locked in full extension. The postoperative course was uneventful, and radiographic control was satisfactory (). On the second postoperative day, the patient began ambulation with a walker while keeping the extension knee braces. Full weight-bearing was permitted as tolerated, along with isometric quadriceps-strengthening exercises. The rest of the protocol is as follows: knee flexion exercises limited to 45\u00b0 were started at the second postoperative week. He had no pain and reached 45\u00b0 of active bilateral knee flexion. He had an active flexion of 80\u00b0 at the sixth week, and the knee braces were discontinued. In the eighth postoperative week, the patient achieved a bilateral active complete knee extension and could walk without crutches. As part of his daily physiotherapy program, he was allowed full knee flexion along with a focus on muscle strengthening exercises. Twelve weeks after surgery, the patient presented 100\u00b0 maximum bilateral knee flexion and returned to work.\nUpon examination seven months after surgery, the patient showed an adequate range of motion of both knees (135\u00b0 flexion, 0\u00b0 extension) (). Quadriceps muscle, the primary contributor to knee joint stability, had a good strength with no clinical signs of muscular atrophy or extensor lag. The patient denied any sense of instability, and, consequently, he returned to his recreational sports activities. In addition, he reported feeling that his knees were as strong as they were before the accident. At the final follow-up 12 months after the injury, the patient was symptom-free and extremely satisfied as he recovered completely.", "Question": "Using the adjusted body weight formula, what is the patient's adjusted body weight in terms of kg?", "LLM Answer": "96.6", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "87.795", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient's gender is Male.\nThe patient's height is 180.0 cm, which is 180.0 cm * 0.393701 in/cm = 70.866 in. \nFor males, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows:\nIBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60)\nPlugging in the values gives us 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (70.866 (in inches) - 60) = 74.992 kg.\nHence, the patient's IBW is 74.992 kg.The patient's weight is 107.0 kg.

Spinal anesthesia was administered with the patient in the right lateral position using a 26-gauge Quincke spinal needle at the L3-4 interspace with 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine 8 mg under standard aseptic conditions. The patient was then placed in the supine position. During the pin-prick test, the patient became unresponsive with BP 70/40 mmHg and HR 40-45 beats/min. Repeated ephedrine administration intravenously (IV) followed by epinephrine 10 \u00b5g and full dripping of the crystalloid did not increase the BP. Endotracheal intubation was performed after 7-8 minutes of manual ventilation and norepinephrine 0.1 \u00b5g/kg/min, dopamine 2 \u00b5g/kg/min were administered continuously. The patient's BP and HR was still 60/40 mmHg and 110 beats/min, respectively, and IV epinephrine 0.02 \u00b5g/kg/min was started. The ABGA at that time revealed the following: PaO2 = 488.9 mmHg, PaCO2 = 30.8 mmHg at FiO2 1.0, and EtCO2 = 28 mmHg and O2 saturation = 99%. The cause was suspected to be high spinal anesthesia rather than a pulmonary embolism because of the ABGA findings. Central venous catheterization via the right internal jugular vein was performed to administer the drugs and for hemodynamic monitoring. The central venous pressure was 30 mmHg and emergent TEE was performed immediately. TEE revealed an enlargement of the right atrium (RA) and right ventricle (RV), straightening of the interventricular septum and hypokinesia, which were consistent with PE. IV heparine 5,000 IU was administered and maintained at 1,000 IU/hr. 50 \u00b5g/kg of milrinone IV was loaded for 10 minutes and maintained at 0.5 \u00b5g/kg/min to manage RV failure. The ABGA results exhibited pH 7.224, PaO2 55.2 mmHg and PaCO2 52.8 mmHg, which were also consistent with PE.\nThe operation was postponed and the patient was transported to the intensive care unit (ICU). Twenty minutes later, her heart beat decreased to 30 beats/min and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed. Chest 3 dimensional PTCA and non-contrast brain CT were performed when the patient's hemodynamic parameter became temporarily stable.\nA low density ovoid thromboembolism from the lobar pulmonary artery of the left lower lobe to the entire segmental pulmonary artery of the left lower lobe and enlargement of the right atrium and ventricle, which suggested a poor prognosis, was observed on the enhanced PCTA (). In addition, a low density large acute infarct at the right MCA territory with gyral swelling of the right insula and temporal lobe were noted on the non-enhanced brain CT scan ().

She had no history of evaluation or treatment for her symptoms, although the symptoms started at the age of high school. Her symptoms became worse with time, and she presented with NYHA class III exertional dyspnea and orthopnea. Her height, weight, and body surface area were 156 cm, 49 kg, and 1.45 m2 respectively. Her vital signs were blood pressure 104/68 mmHg, heart rate 104/min, and respiratory rate 22/min. A regular heart beat was detected with wide fixed splitting of S2 at the pulmonary valve area, and no clubbing of the fingers or nails was observed. A simple chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly and a dilated pulmonary trunk with cephalization of pulmonary vascular marking. Electrocardiography revealed normal sinus rhythm with compatible findings of RV hypertrophy. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a large tissue defect of 29 mm with a bi-directional shunt through the interatrial septum (). The RV was prominently dilated and revealed significantly decreased contractility with a D-shaped left ventricle (LV) showing normal contractility (). There was no significant RV hypertrophy. The systolic pulmonary arterial pressure measured by maximal tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TR Vmax) was estimated at 95 mmHg (TR Vmax = 4.6 m/sec), which was roughly equal to systemic systolic blood pressure (). Her walking distance was 362 m on the 6-minute walking test with slightly decreased oxygen saturation from 98% to 92%. Further evaluations to identify the etiology of the pulmonary hypertension included a pulmonary function test, chest computed tomography angiogram and autoimmune panel, but all were negative.\nCardiac catheterization confirmed severe pulmonary hypertension with a mean pulmonary arterial pressure of 48 mmHg (76/36 mmHg absolute) and pulmonary vascular resistance (Rp) of 9.6 Wood units (WU) on room air. The mean systemic arterial pressure was 84 mmHg (97/73 mmHg absolute). After administering oxygen (10 L/min for 10 minutes via a nasal prong) and inhaling iloprost, her mean pulmonary arterial pressure was 50 and 46 mmHg respectively, and had not changed significantly. We failed to identify the pulmonary arterial responsibility after pulmonary vasodilator administration. Based on these findings, closure of the ASD was not performed. Instead, medical treatment including oral bosentan was started to improve patient's symptom.\nHer symptoms and exercise tolerance improved from NYHA class III to NYHA class I to II after 1 year of using bosentan. She was able to walk 426 m during the 6-min walk test without desaturation. A follow-up echocardiogram showed no significant interval change except slight improvement in RV contractility compared to the initial echocardiogram, even though her symptoms were much improved. TR Vmax was 4.3 m/sec by continuous wave Doppler test, but there was no significant improvement in comparison with the initial test. Although the follow-up echocardiogram result was very disappointing, we decided to perform a cardiac catheterization and balloon occlusion test to confirm the change in Rp and possibly correct the ASD. We expected some favorable changes in pulmonary vascular physiology, because her exercise tolerance had much improved.\nA follow-up cardiac catheterization revealed severe pulmonary hypertension with mean pulmonary arterial pressure of 45 mmHg (75/29 mmHg absolute). The mean aortic pressure was 74 mmHg (95/60 mmHg absolute). Although the patient still had severe pulmonary hypertension, Rp had decreased markedly from 9.6 to 4.2 WU and calculated pulmonary to systemic flow ratio (Qp/Qs) increased from 1.9 to 2.6 in comparison with the initial data. We performed the transient balloon occlusion test using a 34 mm sizing balloon for 10 minutes. As a result, mean pulmonary arterial pressure decreased to 36 mmHg (48/25 mmHg absolute), and mean aortic pressure increased to 85 mmHg (118/70 mmHg absolute). We decided to close the ASD with a transcatheter occluder device considering her young age and the high perioperative risk. We performed percutaneous closure of the defect with a 34 mm Amplatzer\u00ae septal occluder (AGA Medical Corp., Minneapolis, MN, USA).\nNo residual leak was observed on the follow-up transthoracic echocardiography. The patient was given antiplatelet therapy and was maintained on 62.5 mg bosentan bid with diuretics and an angiotensin receptor blocker for 1 year. Finally, her physical activity and symptoms were much improved as she could walk 554 m on the walk test 1 year after the device was deployed. A chest X-ray showed remarkably decreased pulmonary vascularity, but cardiomegaly remained. Follow-up transthoracic echocardiography showed increased left atrial size from 37 to 42 mm and LV chamber size of end-diastole/end-systole from 40/23 to 46/28 mm.

The metabolic acidosis in this patient could not be explained solely by lactic acidosis following seizure activity so other potential causes were explored. A thorough history of the patient\u2019s family revealed that the patient drank homemade alcohol three days prior to presentation. Methanol poisoning was diagnosed on the basis of the previously mentioned history and initial evaluation and the decision was made to begin hemodialysis. Due to the history of head trauma, a computed tomography scan (CT scan) of the brain was performed prior to sending the patient to the dialysis unit (). Protective measures including ethanol gavage, folic acid, and sodium bicarbonate were administered to the patient while waiting to begin hemodialysis. Hemodialysis was then performed for four hours. Following hemodialysis, the patient\u2019s acidosis was reduced, and the clinical features were improved. Approximately one hour later, the patient\u2019s level of consciousness decreased and unilateral mydriasis with negative pupillary light response (anisocoria) developed in the right eye. The patient was immediately intubated and brain CT scan was repeated (). A large epidural hematoma was seen in the right fronto-parietal lobe with evidence of mass effect.

Urinalysis revealed large blood by dipstick with 31 to 50 RBCs (patient was menstruating), negative results for nitrite and leukocyte esterase. Urine toxicology was negative for illicit drugs, and the urine pregnancy test was negative. Chest radiograph was negative for any lung pathology, mediastinum was normal width and no pathology was seen on the thoracic vertebrae. Computed tomography angiogram of the chest was normal; no aortic dissection was found.\nAn intravenous catheter was inserted when blood was drawn for laboratory evaluation. Hydromorphone 0.5 mg and diazepam 2.5 mg was intravenously given for pain relief and normal saline was begun at 150 ml/hour. Approximately one hour after arrival the patient complained of aching all over and then began to vomit, undigested food with no blood. She mentioned to the staff that a friend with whom she had had dinner had called her and told her that she was also ill. The patient explained that they had eaten fish that her friend had purchased at a local market and cooked for dinner. It was buffalo fish (Ictiobus).\nAfter reviewing the laboratory values, the rate of intravenous normal saline was increased to 300 ml/hour. The patient was further questioned for an etiology of the rhabdomyolysis and an ingestion of a toxin was considered. An Internet search was performed looking at buffalo fish and rhabdomyolysis, and information on Haff disease was identified. The Illinois Poison Control Center was notified. The Illinois Poison Control Center subsequently contacted the Cook County Board of Health and all buffalo fish were removed from the local market.\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital for continued hydration.

The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 135.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 135.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 135.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 135.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 135.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 135.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 105.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 105.0 mmol.

She was prescribed a course of azithromycin for presumed bronchitis. The following day, she presented to her local emergency department with acute onset of severe shortness of breath and associated chest pain. She was found to be hypotensive (90/60 mmHg), tachycardic (115 beats/min), and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a presumptive diagnosis of septic shock. Norepinephrine and empiric IV vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam were started. Initial labs revealed: white blood cell count (WBC) 12.7/\u03bcL with 77.9% neutrophils, hemoglobin 12.7 g/dl, hematocrit 39.8%, platelets 141, lactate 8.2 mmol/L, sodium (Na) 149 mmol/L, potassium (K) 4.3 mmol/L, bicarbonate 16 mmol/L, chloride (Cl) 115, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 28, creatinine (Cr) 1.3 mg/dl, blood glucose 214 mg/dl, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 128 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 200, alkaline phosphatase (AP) 104 IU/L, serum troponin I 12.6 ng/ml, and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) 339 U/L. Her electrocardiogram revealed an accelerated junctional rhythm with a rate of 115 beats/min, poor R wave progression and low voltage. An emergent transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed severely impaired left ventricular (LV) function with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 10%. Within 24 hours of presentation her condition deteriorated and she required intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient then was transferred to our center for further management.\nUpon arrival the patient was intubated, sedated, and afebrile. Her blood pressure was 70/40 mmHg and she had a heart rate of 110 beats/min. Examination revealed bilateral crepitations in the lungs, normal heart sounds and a benign abdomen. Her skin was mottled; and her extremities were cold and clammy. There was no pedal edema. Chest radiograph revealed diffuse bilateral patchy infiltrates and pulmonary vascular congestion. A repeat TTE demonstrated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 10%, normal LV and RV dimensions, moderate mitral regurgitation, left ventricle wall thickness of 12 mm, and global hypokinesis of LV with minor regional variation. There was no evidence of a pericardial effusion. Notable labs were a WBC 14.8/\u03bcL with 82% neutrophils, hematocrit 36.5%, platelets 113, CPK 365 U/L, troponin 7.6 ng/ml and Cr 0.76 mg/dl. The patient remained hypotensive despite maximum doses of norepinephrine, dobutamine and vasopressin. She was continued on empiric antibiotics and empiric oseltamivir (75 mg twice daily) was added. Immediate left and right heart catheterization demonstrated normal coronary anatomy, with a cardiac index of 1.16 L/min/m2. Emergent venoarterial ECMO (flow = 4 L/min) was placed via left common femoral vein and artery.\nOn day 3 of hospitalization, pulmonary congestion significantly improved but another repeat TTE showed persistent severe LV systolic dysfunction with an EF of 15%. Endotracheal aspiration at admission returned positive for influenza B by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy was performed on hospital day 3 (total 4 specimens). Histopathology was negative for inflammation. Immunohistochemical stain for parvovirus B19, HHV6, HSV and PCR for enteroviruses, EBV and CMV were all negative. Bronchoscopy revealed mild mucosal erythema with clear secretions. The bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was negative for enteroviruses, adenoviruse, CMV, EBV and HSV by PCR. Blood, BAL and urine cultures were negative for bacterial growth and empiric antimicrobials were stopped on day 5 and oseltamivir was continued for a total of 7 days.\nThe patient\u2019s clinical status gradually improved, inotropic support was stopped and a repeat TTE on day 7 showed significant recovery of left ventricular function with an estimated EF of 50%, and ECMO support was able to be withdrawn.\nThe patient was extubated on hospital day 8; low doses of a \u03b2 -blocker and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor were started. The patient\u2019s course was complicated by a pseudoaneurysm of the left common femoral artery secondary to the ECMO therapy, which was repaired successfully. She was discharged on hospital day 15. Transthoracic echocardiography one month after discharge demonstrated normal LV systolic function with an EF of 60%, normal LV wall thickness, trace mitral regurgitation and no ventricular dilation.\nDuring the 1918\u20131919 influenza pandemic an association between myocarditis and influenza viruses was noted during an autopsy study []. While there have been reports of fulminant myocarditis or cardiomyopathy associated with influenza B in children, it has very rarely been reported in adults [,-]. In 1958, a group of four patients with pericarditis, subacute myocarditis, and fatal chronic myocarditis associated with influenza B were documented []. Ray CG et al. described a 34-year-old healthy woman who presented with acute onset of dilated cardiomyopathy and cardiogenic shock following a few days of flu like syndrome. She had a very complicated course and died 6 weeks after the onset of symptoms. Influenza B virus was isolated from the nasopharynx and the diagnosis of acute myocarditis was confirmed by cardiac autopsy [].\nMcCarthy et al. described fulminant myocarditis as a distinct clinical presentation of abrupt onset of severe heart failure and cardiogenic shock preceded by a viral syndrome similar to our patient []. The typical echocardiographic findings in fulminant myocarditis are described as near normal ventricular dimensions, severely depressed LV systolic function, and increased left ventricle wall thickness []. Histological diagnosis of fulminant myocarditis can be difficult especially in the early phase of disease. The limited sensitivity of cardiac biopsy for detection of myocarditis is well recognized and negative cardiac biopsies results cannot exclude the diagnosis of myocarditis []. Myocarditis usually presents as a focal or patchy infiltration predominantly in the lateral free wall of the left ventricle and often not involving the right ventricle, therefore, biopsies taken from the right ventricle could be falsely negative [].\nThis patient\u2019s clinical presentation of refractory cardiogenic shock 6 days after the onset of influenza and severely impaired left ventricular systolic function, and subsequent normalization of ventricular function after recovery of her viral illness; taken together with her typical echocardiogram findings in the setting of normal coronaries supports the clinical diagnosis of viral fulminant myocarditis; regardless of non diagnostic right ventricle biopsies. During influenza infection, severe myocardial dysfunction can be caused not only by direct injury to cardiac myocytes but also by overexpression of cytokines and severe inflammatory response to viral infection resulting cytokine and humoral mediated forms of myocarditis with no cellular infiltrate.\nThe reason for the unexpected severity of influenza B infection in our patient was not clear. Clinical data about risk factors and complications of influenza B are limited. Her only past medical history was remote myasthenia gravis and thymectomy over 20 years prior. The predominant circulating B strain was B/Wisconsin/1/2010- LIKE when the patient presented to the hospital, which was matched with the B component of the 2012\u20132013 vaccine []. We do not know if the patient had received an influenza vaccine this season. The possible lack of immunologic memory for this infection might have contributed to the severity of influenza B virus infection in our patient. Increasing awareness among patients and physicians about the importance of vaccination as the most important strategy for minimizing the severe complications of influenza infection could help to prevent similar cases in the future.\nThe treatment of influenza associated fulminant myocarditis still remains supportive. Studies have shown the early use of mechanical circulatory support for patients with fulminant myocarditis and cardiogenic shock who fail aggressive pharmacologic treatment would increase survival rate [,].

His medical history revealed a cardiac fibroma that was detected prenatally. After birth, the fibroma was partially resected twice at another hospital, as the size and extent of the tumor prohibited single-stage resection. Heart transplantation was considered at the time. At the age of 2 years, he experienced cardiac arrest and was admitted to the same hospital. At that time, ventricular tachycardia was repeatedly detected. He developed central nervous system complications, including hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and quadriplegia, after which he had received oral amiodarone. Later, hydrocephalus was detected on brain magnetic resonance imaging, and he was treated with a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt.\nThe patient\u2019s medication was discretionally discontinued at 10 years of age. At 12 years of age, he experienced a cyanotic spell at home and was unable to breathe. He received cardiopulmonary resuscitation from his father. When the rescue squad arrived, they determined that he was in ventricular fibrillation. Defibrillation was performed, and sinus rhythm was restored. The boy was transported to a local hospital where he received endotracheal intubation. Thereafter, he was referred to our hospital, where he was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit.\nOn admission, the patient\u2019s blood pressure and heart rate were 115/70 mm Hg and 151 beats per minute, respectively. He was intubated and was in a stuporous state. Cardiac murmurs were not heard on chest auscultation. Venous blood gas analysis revealed pH, 7.22; pCO2, 58 mm Hg; pO2, 28 mm Hg; HCO3, 18.9 mmol/L; and SvO2, 39%. Serum biochemical analysis showed a lactate level of 9.25 mmol/L. The levels of serum electrolytes were as follows: sodium, 142 mEq/L; potassium, 3.6 mEq/L; chloride, 109 mEq/L; total calcium, 8.4 mEq/L; ionized calcium, 2.3 mEq/L; inorganic phosphorous, 4.0 mg/dL; and magnesium, 1.7 mg/dL.

Cardiomegaly was observed on chest radiography (). Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with intermittent monomorphic ventricular premature contractions (VPCs). On the 1st day of hospitalization, the patient was supported by mechanical ventilation, without an intravenous inotropic agent. On the 2nd day, VPCs preceded abrupt ventricular fibrillation. He was resuscitated with sinus rhythm restoration following cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation (2 J/kg). Transthoracic echocardiography () and cardiac computed tomography () demonstrated a known fibroma (about 9.5 cm \u00d7 5.5 cm) in the anteroseptal wall of the left ventricle without blood flow obstruction. Soon after, he developed ventricular tachycardia (), and direct current cardioversion was performed along with intravenous amiodarone administration. Additionally, intravenous dopamine was administered for hypotension management. From the third to 9th days of hospitalization, he experience recurrent ventricular tachycardia refractory to multiple (45 times) direct current cardioversions (2 to 4 J/kg) and aggressive administration of antiarrhythmic agents (intravenous amiodarone and lidocaine). Although we suspected that the fibroma induced the arrhythmia, we believed additional partial resection of the tumor would not prevent it.

The patient\u2019s past history was significant for myocardial infarction. A recent echocardiogram showed left ventricular hypokinesis consistent with an ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%. Previous magnetic resonance imaging showed a 9x11x16 mm meningioma, without metastasis, edema or hydrocephalus. Her medications included verapamil, timolol, and diazepam.\nThe initial assessment by paramedics at 1320 described an alert and appropriate patient with pupils equal, round and reactive; the breathing was not labored, lungs were clear, and finger stick glucose was 139. The rhythm was ventricular tachycardia. Paramedics gave 50mg lidocaine intravenous (IV) push, with resolution of the tachycardia to a narrow complex sinus rhythm at a rate of 80 beats per minute. The rhythm was stable for one to two minutes, then recurred. They administered a second dose of lidocaine 50mg IV push, resulting in resolution of the tachycardia to a sinus rate of 78 beats per minute. The patient reported a decrease in shortness of breath and some mild dizziness. Paramedic personnel initiated a lidocaine drip at 2mg/minute for transport to the emergency department (ED).\nIn the primary ED, 28 minutes later, the patient had a ventricular rate of 152 beats per minute. She received a third 50mg dose of lidocaine IV. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and an anteroseptal infarct of indeterminate age. At 1413 the physician increased the lidocaine drip to 4mg/minute, and administered aspirin 325mg by mouth. Shortly thereafter, the patient received a loading dose of amiodarone 150mg IV, followed by an amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. She then came via EMS to our hospital.\nEn route emergency medical service personnel noted the patient to be in normal sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy. The lidocaine drip remained at 4mg/minute and the amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. The IV pump delivering amiodarone failed 20 minutes into the transfer and the medication discontinued. During transfer the report notes that the patient complained of \u201cbeing sleepy\u201d but was alert and appropriate. Six minutes prior to arrival the patient\u2019s mental status changed abruptly.

Her weight was 49 kilograms. Her airway was patent. The EKG monitor showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was unresponsive to painful stimuli with pupils 4mm and nonreactive with intact gag reflex. Plantar reflexes were neutral. Given the patient\u2019s abrupt change in mental status, brainstem stroke was considered and we consulted neurology. We ordered an expedited computerized tomographic scan (CT) of the head 19 minutes after arrival. Two minutes later she received 0.4mg naloxone intraveniously and the lidocaine drip was discontinued. The patient\u2019s National Institute of Health (NIH) stroke score was 24, indicating severe neurologic impairment.\nInitial imaging studies included a chest x-ray with the only abnormality being an enlarged cardiac silhouette. CT scan of the head revealed mild microvascular ischemic changes. An 11 mm partially calcified right falcine mass was consistent with a stable meningioma. CT angiography examination in the ED 51 minutes after arrival demonstrated no evidence of vaso-occlusive change affecting the cervical or intracranial arterial vessels.

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 137.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 137.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 137.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed.

The patient had no ptosis, and her respiration was normal. A dermatologic exam was unremarkable. She had no history of diarrhea or toxin exposure. Her daily medication consisted of a tablet of ferrous fumarate and a single supplement containing iron, iodine, and folic acid (Triferdine). She had no significant prior antenatal history, no hearing problem, no sign of autoimmune disease, no history of dry eyes or dry mouth, no history of diuretic intake, no history of chronic alcohol intake, and no family history of weakness and hypokalemia.\nIn the initial assessment, the patient was afebrile, and her blood pressure was 109/65 mmHg. A neurological examination revealed the following motor power: grade 3/5 in both arms, grade 4/5 in both forearms, grade 4/5 in both thighs, and grade 5/5 in both legs. All the deep tendon reflexes were 2+. The well-being of the fetus was assured by a nonstress test. Normal fetal bone development and mineralization were observed by ultrasound.\nInvestigations showed a total leukocyte count of 8,310/mm3 (5000\u201310000), with a neutrophil count of 68% (40\u201375), a lymphocyte count of 24% (20\u201350), a monocyte count of 6% (2\u201310), and eosinophil count of 2% (1\u20136). The hemoglobin was 11.7 g (11\u201315), platelets were 261,000 cells/mm3 (140,000\u2013400,000), serum potassium was 2.0 mmol/L (3.5\u20135.0), sodium was 139.5 mmol/L (135\u2013145), and chloride was 108 mmol/L (97\u2013110). Bicarbonate was 19.9 mmol/L (22\u201332), and it decreased over the next few days to 16.0 mmol/L. In addition, albumin was 3.2 g/dL (3.4\u20135.0), calcium was 9.7 mg/dL (8.4\u201310.4), corrected serum calcium was 10.34 mg/dL, magnesium was 1.8 mg/dL (1.8\u20132.4), phosphorus was 3.8 mg/dL (2.5\u20134.5), blood sugar was 114 mg%, BUN was 4.1 mg/dL (7\u201318), creatinine was 0.52 mg/dL (0.55\u20131.02), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 194 U/L (15\u201337), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 124 U/L (0\u201365), globulin was 2.7 g/dL (2.8\u20133.3), total bilirubin was 0.43 g/dL (0.0\u201310.0), direct bilirubin was 0.22 mg/dL (0\u20130.50), and alkaline phosphatase was 137 U/L (40\u2013150). Urine analysis was negative for blood and urinary tract infections. The urinary pH was 7.0 (5.0\u20137.5) on a pH meter, and the urinary ketone level was 2+. CPK was 5,338 IU/L (<145). Thyroid function tests were in the normal limit for a third-trimester pregnancy, and serum morning cortisol was mildly increased. Urine was collected after 24 h. The 24 h urine potassium level was elevated at 77 mmol, suggesting hypokalemia from renal losses. Serum anion gap was 13.6 mmol/L. The reduction in bicarbonate and normal anion gap pointed to normal anion gap metabolic acidosis. The patient had no history of extrarenal causes of normal anion gap metabolic acidosis such as vomiting, diarrhea, gastrointestinal fistula, and laxative abuse. These data suggest renal tubular acidosis as a cause. Urine pH of 7.0 pointed out that kidneys could not acidify urine compatible with distal tubular dysfunction. Her serum phosphate was normal and she had no glucosuria. Serum bicarbonate easily increased to 20.9 mmol/L after 0.36 mEq/kg administration. So, all data suggest that she had distal RTA. Then she had no history and no clinical suggestion of anemia and autoimmune disease and had no history of deafness, and besides the fact that screening tests for the underlying causes of the distal RTA were normal the etiology in this case was indeterminate. The serum uric acid was 4.1 mg/dL, antinuclear antibody was negative, and a whole abdomen ultrasound showed mild hydronephrosis, without any detectable renal mass or stones.\nTreatments included hydration, correction of the metabolic acidosis with alkali therapy, and potassium supplementation. The patient's clinical and laboratory test results gradually improved. One week after starting the treatments, all the laboratory test results were negative. The patient was discharged.\nAt 412/7 weeks of gestation, the patient was diagnosed with failure to progress and was taken to the operating room for a cesarean section. A healthy male newborn was delivered. The newborn weighted 3,360 g at birth, and he had an Apgar score of 9 and 10 at 1 and 5 min, respectively. Thin meconium-stained amniotic fluid was found.

She did however report a remarkable increase in lower back pain that she had attributed to strenuous exercise.\nTwo days prior to her presentation to the emergency department, the young lady had attended a party where she consumed over 300 mL of vodka and ingested twenty 500 mg tablets of acetaminophen later that night.\nPast medical history revealed that she had experienced an episode of rash after having taken liquid acetaminophen as a child. She had not taken acetaminophen since infancy and also denied regular use of any other analgesic. Family history was non-contributory for relevant physiological and psychological illness. The patient reported feeling stressed due to a recent slip in school grades, however denied any suicidal ideation.\nPhysical examination in the emergency department revealed blood pressure of 140/92 mmHg, pulse 80 bpm, temperature 36.9\u00b0C, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 100% at room air.

She ingested no laxatives or diuretics, nor did the patient abuse alcohol or other drugs. The patient denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, weakness, fever, night sweats, weight loss and heat intolerance. The patient is mother of two healthy daughters.\nPhysical examination was normal. The blood pressure was normotensive (136/80 mmHg), no oedema were detected. ECG was normal. Laboratory tests showed hypokalaemia (3.0 mmol/L), low-normal total serum calcium (2.31 mmol/L), hyperaldosteronism (515 ng/L, 847 ng/L) (normal range 30\u2013340), hyperreninaemia (43.1 ng/L, 25.6 ng/L) (normal range 2.0\u201324.6) and increased calcium excretion in the urine [7.5 mmol/day or 0.13 mmol/kg body weight/day (normal range <6.2 mmol/day or <0.1 mmol/kg body weight/day)].

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 139.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 139.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 139.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 139.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 139.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 104.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L.

She was scheduled to be admitted to the orthopedic department for pain control of lumbar spinal canal stenosis. However, she vomited once in the morning a week before presentation and was unable to bathe without assistance two days prior to admission. Blood tests revealed severe renal impairment. The patient was referred to the department of internal medicine for consultation on the day of admission. This patient\u2019s medical history included medial osteoarthritis of the left knee, lumbar spinal canal stenosis, and an L2 vertebral fracture two years before admission. There were no malignant findings. She was followed by her general practitioner for blood tests every six months. Her creatinine was 0.64 mg/dL eight months prior to the hospital visit and 1.14 mg/dL one month prior to the hospital admission with no further investigation. Her vital statistics were as follows: height 142 cm, weight 41.8 kg; blood pressure 145/76 mmHg, pulse rate 74 beats/min, body temperature 36.4\u00b0C, respiratory rate 16 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) 98%. Blood tests revealed severe renal dysfunction with the following levels: blood urea nitrogen 139.9 mg/dL, creatinine 16.81 mg/dL, Na 134 mEq/l, K 7.5 mEq/l, Cl 100 mEq/l, Ca 8.1 mg/dL, P 11.4 mg/dL, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 101 mm/hour. Urinalysis showed white blood cells (2+), protein (2+), occult blood (1+), and granular and waxy casts in the urine sediments on the fourth day of admission (Tables -). Blood gas tests revealed the following: pH 7.146, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) 21.6 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3) 7.2 mmol/L, cK+ 7.5 mmol/L, cLac 0.4 mmol/L, and AnGap 16.9 mmol/L. The lab tests indicated metabolic acidosis with an enlarged anion gap.\nEmergency hemodialysis with a right internal jugular vein catheter was initiated on the second day of admission. Considering further rapid progression, steroids were urgently administered on the third day of admission due to suspicion of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated glomerulonephropathy. This was performed prior to a bone marrow biopsy and immunofixation electrophoresis. Considering renal atrophy and renal damage due to malignancy, an abdominal CT, head MRI, and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were performed. However, there was no renal atrophy, and no obvious malignant findings were observed (Figure ). Additional tests for antinuclear antibody, anti-streptolysin 0 antibody, anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody, and anticardiolipin antibody were all normal. The serum immunoelectrophoresis that we had submitted on the second day of admission came back on the eighth day, and the IgG, IgA, and IgM had decreased. On the twentieth day of admission, a renal biopsy of the right kidney was performed. Crystals in the tubules and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-negative urinary casts suggested acute kidney injury associated with cast nephropathy (Figures -). Additional investigations were performed to determine the cause of the cast nephropathy. On the 33rd day of admission, Bence-Jones protein-\u03bb M protein was detected in the urine. And IgD-\u03bb M protein and Bence-Jones protein-\u03bb protein were detected on the 36th day (Figure ). Additional blood data showed a \u03bb type free light chain of 8440 mg/L (\u03ba/\u03bb ratio of <0.001). This indicated light chain MM or monoclonal gammaglobulinemia (MGRS). Bone marrow examination showed scattered plasma cell nests of 23%, which was consistent with MM (Figure ). Finally, the patient was diagnosed with IgD-\u03bb type MM. There were indications for treatment. However, based on a discussion with a hematologist, it was concluded that active treatment for myeloma would not improve the patient\u2019s condition. This patient was bedridden and her condition was poor. The side effects of the treatment could have impinged on her appetite and condition. When we discussed this with the patient, she refused to undergo chemotherapy or further active treatment. As a result of this discussion, we decided to treat her with palliative measures. For the anemia, we employed a blood transfusion and a darbepoetin alfa injection. Maintenance dialysis was initiated for the chronic renal failure.

The abdominal pain, accompanied by nausea and vomiting, kept increasing gradually for eight hours. The patient was diagnosed with major depression and bulimia nervosa nine years ago. The patient also had a history of frequent vomiting after episodes of binge eating, along with numerous suicide attempts. Ten hours before reporting to the hospital, the patient ate a very large quantity food, equivalent to approximately ten portions; however, the quantity of the vomit was much less, relative to the amount of food taken. The physical examination revealed abdominal pain and distension in the entire region, along with tenderness, but no rebound tenderness. Subsequent abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed clear gastric distension. The results of various blood tests were normal. In the joint general surgery consultation that followed, it was decided that an immediate surgical treatment was not necessary; hence, the need for continuous observation of the condition was explained, and a gastroenterological or psychiatric hospitalization was advised, but both the patient and her guardians declined hospitalization. Afterward, they were warned of the possible complications, such as electrolyte imbalance, aspiration pneumonia, gastrointestinal perforation, ischemic changes, due to the pressure applied by gastrointestinal distension, and the possibility of death, in case the condition worsened. The self-discharge form was signed, and they returned home.\nSeven hours after returning home, the patient re-visited the emergency room due to persistent abdominal pain, and mental confusion. At the time of the visit, the patient was unconscious. On physical examination, a more severe abdominal distension, and signs of abdominal rigidity were observed. Both legs of the patient had turned pale in color. No auscultation sounds were heard over the abdomen, and the dorsalis pedis pulse was not felt on either foot. Shock was suspected due to a 60/40 mmHg blood pressure, 160 beats/min heart rate, 22 times/minute aspiration rate, and 36.4\u2103 temperature. Other findings included pH 7.076, PaCO2 22.3 mmHg, PaO2 122 mmHg, HCO3- 6.3 mM/L, base excess (BE) 23.7 mM/L, and lactic acid 11.1 mM/L, which were measured in the arterial blood gas analysis and, thus, metabolic acidosis was confirmed. The electrolyte levels Na+ 157 mM/L, K+ 6.2 mM/L, and Cl- 130 mM/L, indicated that the electrolyte imbalance was severe (). In addition, the patient was in a severe hypoglycemic state with a blood sugar level of 15 mg/dl; because of an elevated creatinine level of 2.84 mg/dl, acute renal failure was suspected. First, to treat the metabolic acidosis, sodium bicarbonate was set at 80 mEq/h. In the abdominal X-ray, the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) was seen to be filled with a large amount of food but without any bowel gas (). Abdominal CT revealed a very large dilation of the stomach, esophagus, and the second part of the duodenum; it was suspected that the distended organs were pressing against the descending aorta, and the right kidney was pressed upwards (). One hour after the emergency room re-visit, the patient's mental state became lethargic\u2014communication became impossible and spontaneous respiration decreased; as SpO2 was measured to be 88%, endotracheal intubation was performed. A Foley catheter was then inserted, but no urine was drained; an emergency hemodialysis was prepared, and for enough fluid supply, a central venous catheter was inserted into the right jugular vein. For continuous monitoring of changes in the vital signs, a conduit was placed in the right radial artery. An attempt was made to insert a nasogastric tube to relieve gastrointestinal pressure, but the food was not drained due to a blockage near the esophagus, which made further insertion impossible. An abdominal CT performed for follow-up observation revealed that the abdomen was still filled with food, and the nasogastric tube was twisted at the end of the esophagus (). It was also suspected that insertion was not possible due to gastroesophageal junction deviation or esophageal stenosis; however, no such sign was seen.\nThere was no decompression through the nasogastric tube, and as time passed, the mental state of the patient changed into a state of confusion. The patient\u2019s vital signs became increasingly unstable. Since the symptoms and follow-up blood test results exacerbated, instead of performing a percutaneous drainage, it was decided to attempt a surgical decompression; subsequently, the patient was transferred to the operation room six hours after the re-visit. In the emergency room, a total of 3,170 ml of crystalloid fluid, in which a 5% glucose solution was included, was administered. Urine volume was not measured.\nAfter reaching the operation room, the patient\u2019s blood pressure was 70/46 mmHg and the heart rate was 128 beats/min. First, in order to improve the vital signs, crystalloid fluid was administered at the highest speed via the right arm\u2019s peripheral venous catheter and via the central venous catheter of the right internal jugular vein. The instillation of norepinephrine was initiated with sustained dosing at an additional rate of 0.2 \u03bcg/kg/min, and continuous infusion of vasopressin at 4\u20138 unit/h was also initiated. Subsequently, general anesthesia was induced using sevoflurane 1\u20132 vol% and rocuronium 50 mg. In the arterial blood gas analysis conducted after entering the operating room, pH 7.45, PaCO2 20.8 mmHg, PaO2 335 mmHg, Na+ 161 mM/L, K+ 3.8 mM/L, glucose 205 mg/dl, lactate 13 mM/L, hemoglobin 6.8 g/dl, and HCO3- 14.4 mM/L were measured (). Four units of erythrocytes were prescribed to correct the reduced hemoglobin, and 20 mg of furosemide was injected due to a continuous lack of urination. Furthermore, for rapid transfusion, the rapid infusion system (RIS) was connected to the central venous catheter of the right internal jugular vein, and the transfusion of four erythrocyte units was initiated.\nThe operating surgeon planned and performed a gastrotomy, after making a skin incision of approximately 10 cm and within 20 min of beginning the surgery. The food and 5,000 ml of body fluid present in the stomach were drained via suction. Thirty minutes after the operation, blood pressure was maintained low at 60/40 mmHg and almost all food was drained; as a large amount of continuous gastric bleeding occurred after decompression, a total of 6,000 ml was drained into the suction bottle. In the follow-up arterial blood gas analysis, results showed: pH 6.75, PaCO2 46 mmHg, and lactate 20 mM/L. Acidosis had worsened, the blood sugar level had significantly increased to 469 mg/dl, electrolyte imbalance had exacerbated with K+ 7.5 mM/L, and hemoglobin had fallen to 4.3 g/dl, suggesting a large amount of bleeding. To correct this, 60 mEq of sodium bicarbonate, and two units of insulin were administered. Further, 1.2 g of calcium chloride was administered to treat hyperkalemia. Moreover, additional 20 \u03bcg of epinephrine was injected to correct persistent hypotension.\nBleeding in the stomach continued, and despite initiating erythrocyte transfusion via RIS, hemoglobin level decreased. As a result, a large amount of internal bleeding was suspected, and additional eight units of erythrocytes, and eight units of fresh frozen plasma were prescribed. The operating surgeon tried to determine the cause and area of bleeding, but as the surgical incision was only 10 cm, abdominal organs other than the stomach could not be identified with the naked eye. To reduce bleeding, the operating surgeon considered performing a total gastrectomy or extending the abdominal incision to confirm the bleeding areas from, other organs but concluded that the bleeding was due to ischemia-reperfusion injury after surgical decompression, and DIC. Since the patient\u2019s vital signs steadily worsened, it was decided that the abdomen be closed urgently, and the patient moved to the intensive care unit (ICU).\nOne hour after the start of the operation, suturing after gastrectomy was completed. When the closing of the abdomen started, non-invasive blood pressure was not measured, and flat waveforms were observed in the catheter of the right radial artery. There was no pulse detected via palpation, and after confirming pulseless electrical activity through the observation of electrocardiogram, an additional 1 mg of epinephrine was injected, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated.\nA total of 3 mg of epinephrine was injected, with cardiac rhythm monitoring at 2 min intervals; afterward, 2 units of vasopressin were injected at 2 min intervals, totaling an injection of 4 units of vasopressin. After completing the abdominal closure while performing CPR, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit, and no urine output was seen until the patient left the operation room.\nThe operation was conducted for 1 h 20 min, and the anesthesia time was 1 h 50 min. During the operation, a total of 800 ml, four erythrocyte units, were transfused, and 6,200 ml of crystalloid fluid were administered. A total of 6,000 ml was drained into the suction bottle\u20145,000 ml of food and body fluid through the suction unit via gastrectomy, and 1000 ml due to bleeding that had occurred after decompression from the start of the operation until finish; however, as mentioned earlier, the incision area was small, and bleeding occurring from other abdominal organs could not be confirmed, making it difficult to estimate the exact estimated blood loss. Additionally, prescribed erythrocytes and fresh frozen plasma were transfused through the RIS as the patient left the operation room.\nAfter entering the ICU, CPR was stopped due to a return of spontaneous circulation, but the existing usage of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin was preserved, and transfusion continued. However, blood pressure was still not measured, an additional 1,000 ml of bleeding was confirmed through the nasogastric tube, and bleeding from the closed abdominal area continued. Subsequently, as 3.5 g/dl hemoglobin was measured in the follow-up test, transfusion continued, and a 113.1-second prothrombin time, 180-s activated partial thromboplastin time, and platelet count of 22,000/\u03bcl were found, confirming that the patient was in a state of DIC. Despite continuous drug administration and transfusion, the hemoglobin level decreased to 1.8 g/dl, and after three hours in the ICU, the heartbeat disappeared, and the patient was declared dead.", "Question": "What is the patient's delta ratio?", "LLM Answer": "1.73", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "0.479", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the delta ratio is delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L).\nTo compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.

She had asked him to bring her the bottle; approximately five minutes later, he went into another room and she heard a gunshot.\nUpon arrival in the ED, the patient was intubated without medication. He had a systolic blood pressure of 130 mm Hg, a pulse of 111 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 16 via bag-assisted respirations and a temperature of 36.5\u00b0C. Physical exam was notable for a single penetrating wound to the right temporal bone. Pupils were fixed and dilated. There was no evidence of trauma anywhere else on his body. The computed tomography scan of his brain demonstrated a non-survivable head injury with multiple skull fractures, intraparenchymal, intraventricular, subarachnoid and subdural blood. Additionally, there was significant cerebral edema with evidence of tonsillar herniation. The remainder of the physical exam was consistent with brain death, with no additional signs of trauma.

An exact time of ingestion could not be determined. The family located the bottle and found approximately 20 grams of acetaminophen missing, an amount capable of producing fulminant hepatic failure. Given the lack of overdose information with evidence of a significant ingestion, intravenous NAC was continued indefinitely. Charcoal therapy was considered, but with the unknown time of ingestion and the duration of time elapsed from pre-hospital transportation through ED resuscitation, the patient was outside the window for likely therapeutic benefit.\nThe process of brain death evaluation was initiated.

The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 137.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mg to mEq. The mass of sodium is 137.0 mg. To convert from 137.0 mg to mEq, first convert from mg to mmol.To convert 137.0 mg of sodium to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 137.0 mg sodium * 0.001 g/mg = 0.137 g sodium. To convert from grams of sodium to moles, divide by the molar mass 22.99 g/mol, which will give 0.137 g/(22.99 g sodium/mol) = 0.006 mol sodium. To convert 0.006 mol of sodium to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.006 mol sodium * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 6.0 mmol sodium. To convert from 6.0 mmol sodium to mEq, multiply the mmol amount by the valence, to get 6.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 6.0 mEq sodium. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mEq/L. This will result to 6.0 mEq sodium/0.1 L = 60.0 mEq sodium/L. The concentration value of 137.0 mg sodium/dL converts to 60.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 95.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 95.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 95.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 95.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 95.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 95.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 30.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 30.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 30.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 30.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 30.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 30.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 60.0 mEq/L - (95.0 mEq/L + 30.0 mEq/L) = -65.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is -65.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in -65.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get -65.0 - 12 = -77.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is -77.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get -77.0 mEq/L / -6.0 mEq/L = 12.833.

She ingested one seed of this plant, as this was suggested to be the lethal dose, with the intent of ending her life. The exact time between ingestion and presentation was unknown. On transportation to the hospital, the patient had a documented heart rate in the 30s with a junctional rhythm and therefore received a total of 10 vials of Digibind (digoxin immune fab). She denied any headache, visual disturbances, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, abdominal tenderness, diarrhea, or constipation.\nOn presentation, the patient's vital signs were blood pressure of 105/74 mmHg, heart rate of 106 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, body temperature at 98.6 degrees F, and oxygen level of 98% on room air. Physical examination was noted as within normal limits. Labs performed included urine toxicology which was positive for cannabis, digoxin level 0.2 ng/mL, salicylate level less than 1.7 mg/dL, acetaminophen level less than 2 mcg/mL, blood alcohol content of 0, lactic acid 1.2 mmol/L, white blood cell count 8,100/\u03bcL, hemoglobin 13.9 g/dL, hematocrit 40.8%, platelets 165/\u03bcL, sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 4.3 mmol/L, chloride 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate 29 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen 10 mg/dL, creatinine 0.84 mg/dL, glucose 107 mg/dL, total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, AST 37 U/L, ALT 61 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase 48 U/L.\nElectrocardiogram (ECG) was performed shortly after arrival. This demonstrated a significant decrease in heart rate as compared to presenting vital signs. The heart rate had decreased from 106 beats per minute to 36 beats per minute (). Therefore, the patient was monitored on telemetry, and repeat ECGs were ordered. Her heart rate remained in the 30s to 40s, and the rhythm was sinus bradycardia. Upon consultation, the toxicology team recommended to monitor electrolytes and heart rate closely while continuing intravenous fluids. If there were any conduction blocks or further slowing of heart rate, 5 more vials of Digibind could be given. She had a hypoglycemic episode with blood glucose of 60 mg/dL. She was administered dextrose and responded appropriately.\nThe following day, the psychiatry team was consulted, and the patient was diagnosed with gender dysphoria and depressive disorder and noted to have narcissistic and borderline personality traits. The patient met the criteria for inpatient psychiatric hospitalization once medically cleared.\nThe toxicology team continued to follow the patient during her hospitalization. Being that her digoxin level was only 0.2 ng/mL and she had normalized potassium levels, her likelihood for toxicity was low. Given her lab work and improving heart rate on ECGs (Figures and ), the team was reassured that the patient's clinical status was improving.

His physical examination revealed a 3/6 systolic murmur in the aortic area with radiation to the precordium, and a 2/6 diastolic murmur over the mitral area without radiation.\nHis initial laboratory investigations showed white blood cell count of 19.2 k/\u03bcL with 93% neutrophils, hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 26 mg/dL, creatinine 2.2 mg/dL, serum bicarbonate 16 mmol/L, chloride 112 mmol/L, sodium 136 mmol/L, magnesium 1.2 mmol/L. Prothrombin time was 15 seconds, and international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.17. Urine toxicology screen was positive for benzodiazepines. Troponin level was 2.2 ng/mL (normal<0.4). Initial blood cultures were drawn in the emergency department and later grew P. aeruginosa susceptible to amikacin, aztreonam, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam and tobramycin. Serology was positive for Hepatitis C infection and negative for HIV infection.\nOn presentation, he was admitted to the intensive care unit with the diagnosis of septic shock. He was started on intravenous vancomycin, tobramycin, micafungin and cefepime.\nThree sets of blood cultures grew C. parapsilosis susceptible to fluconazole, itraconazole and 5 flucytosine, and P. aeruginosa susceptible to amikacin, aztreonam, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam and tobramycin.\nA 2D echocardiogram showed a bioprosthetic aortic valve with a medium, 10 mm, pedunculated, highly mobile vegetation of the aortic valve attached to the posterior aortic annulus. There was no significant aortic valvular regurgitation. There was mild mitral valvular regurgitation.\nAt day 2 of hospitalization, a transesophageal echocardiogram was done. It showed no aortic abscess but small, 5 mm, mobile vegetation of the aortic valve attached to the non-coronary cusp without significant regurgitation. It also showed large, 10 mm, mobile mitral valve vegetation attached to the anterior leaflet without significant regurgitation.\nThe hospital course was complicated by acute renal failure and acute heart failure for which the patient was aggressively resuscitated. He was electively intubated and medically stabilized to undergo valve replacement 5 days later. Ethical and logistic considerations were the focus of an extensive discussion among the different treating medical and surgical teams given the active injecting drug use while being treated for a relapse of infective endocarditis. The decision was finally made to proceed with the valve replacement surgery. The patient was kept in hospital for the duration of intravenous antibiotics to ensure adherence to therapy and to prevent use of the intravenous access for illicit drug use.\nAt day 7 of hospitalization, he underwent aortic and mitral valve replacement. Cultures from the valves also grew P. aeruginosa and C. parapsilosis. All blood cultures drawn after day 1 were negative.\nTobramycin and cefepime were given for 6 weeks postoperatively. Tobramycin trough levels were measured frequently to ensure therapeutic levels. Micafungin was given for 5 days postoperatively, and replaced by anidulafungin that was given for 26 days. Fluconazole was given for 30 days postoperatively while in hospital and prescribed for 3 months after discharge from the hospital.\nThroughout hospitalization, he remained afebrile and euvolemic without symptoms of heart failure. Two weeks after discharge from the hospital, he returned to the infectious disease clinic, being in good health, without history of fever, excess sweating, chest pain or shortness of breath. Follow-up blood cultures were drawn and were negative.", "Question": "What is the patient's delta ratio?", "LLM Answer": "0.92", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "-0.5", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the delta ratio is delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L).\nTo compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 136.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 136.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 136.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 136.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 136.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 136.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 112.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 112.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 112.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 112.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 112.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 112.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 16.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 16.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 16.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 16.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 16.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 16.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 136.0 mEq/L - (112.0 mEq/L + 16.0 mEq/L) = 8.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 8.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 8.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 8.0 - 12 = -4.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is -4.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get -4.0 mEq/L / 8.0 mEq/L = -0.5. The patient's delta ratio is -0.5.", "Result": "Incorrect"}

He had been prescribed amlodipine 2.5 mg for hypertensive medication. He also underwent radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer two years earlier. He underwent pelvic MRI using gadoterate meglumine (15 mL), immediately after iodide contrast-enhanced chest and abdomen computed tomography (CT) for cancer surveillance. Thirty days before CT scan, his creatinine level was 1.28 mg/dL and his estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 58 mL/min/1.73 m2. After 185 days, he visited a local clinic because of edematous changes in both lower extremities. CT angiography of the lower extremities was performed; no stenosis or occlusion of vessels was observed. Although diuretics were administered for 2 weeks, the edema worsened and was accompanied by pruritus and pain (). Eventually, he was referred to our hospital for further evaluation.\nUpon admission, his body temperature was 36.8\u00b0C and his blood pressure was 110/60 mmHg. His height was 161.3 cm, weight was 53.2 kg and body mass index was 20.4 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed grade 2+ pretibial pitting edema with redness, mild heat, and tenderness in both lower extremities. Both inguinal lymph nodes were not enlarged.\nInitial laboratory findings at admission (about 210 days after MRI scan) were as follows: white blood cell count, 6,200 /\u03bcL (neutrophil 66%, lymphocyte 22%, monocyte 10.3%, eosinophil 0.5%); hemoglobin, 10.7 g/dL; platelet, 253,000 /\u03bcL; blood urea nitrogen, 41 mg/dL; serum creatinine, 2.07 mg/dL; eGFR, 32 mL/min/1.73 m2; serum sodium, 134 mmol/L; potassium, 3.4 mmol/L; chloride, 102 mmol/L; total CO2, 20 mmol/L; calcium, 9.3 mg/dL; phosphate, 1.5 mg/dL; total protein, 6.9 g/dL; albumin, 4.0 g/dL; aspartate transaminase, 43 U/L; alanine aminotransferase, 15 U/L; and C-reactive protein, 0.96 mg/dL. Routine urine analysis revealed a pH of 6.0 and trace proteins. Red and white blood cells were absent in the urine. The spot urine protein/creatinine ratio was 209 mg/g and the spot urine albumin/creatinine ratio was 60 mg/g. Thyroid function tests were normal: thyroid stimulating hormone, 2.47 \u03bcIU/mL and free T4, 0.98 ng/dL. Fractional excretion of Na 0.1% and Fractional excretion of urea on admission was 17.6%, which suggested the patient was prerenal AKI.\nChest radiography and echocardiogram findings were normal. During doppler sonography of both lower extremities, the venous velocity was normal and there was no evidence of thrombosis. None of the aforementioned findings were suggestive of refractory edema.\nFluid therapy was administered to treat the AKI, which was probably caused by the diuretics he was given during his two-week stay in the local clinic. Subsequently, his renal function improved: serum creatinine, 1.18 mg/dL; and eGFR, 63.9 mL/min/1.73 m2. Since the redness and tenderness of both legs were suggestive of cellulitis-associated edema, intravenous cefazolin was administered for two weeks. However, the lesion gradually spread from his ankle to his thigh and changed into fibrotic induration. Contracture of the ankle and knee joints also occurred ().\nTo detect diffuse or localized systemic sclerosis, antinuclear antibody, anti-Scl 70 antibody, and anti-centromere antibody tests were performed, but the results were all negative. Also, eosinophilia and paraproteinemia was not seen, which is commonly accompanied in scleromyxedema or eosinophilic fasciitis. Although approximately 50 weeks had passed since he was exposed to the gadolinium, the characteristic clinical features led to the suspicion of NSF. A biopsy of the right anterior tibial skin lesion was performed to examine tissue for disease. This revealed unique features of the NSF such as dermal thickening with collagen fibers extending into the subcutaneous septa and a large number of spindle-shaped fibrocytes (). Neither eosinophilic tissue infiltration nor fat necrosis with calcification of adipocytes was found.\nSystemic methylprednisolone (20 mg/day) was administered for two weeks to treat the NSF. Additionally, UV-A1 topical phototherapy of 1.5 joule (J)/cm2 was administered to the lower leg lesion twice a week. The patient underwent intensive physical therapy including stretching, pneumatic compression, and Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation . We administered MTX 15 mg weekly while reducing the methylprednisolone dose weekly by half until a dose of 2 mg/day was administered. Simultaneously, the UV-A1 intensity was gradually increased to 3.0 J/cm2. After 6 months of treatment, the reddish edema improved and the skin induration decreased. Although the contracture of the ankles was still present (), there was no further disease progression.

There was no evidence of invasion of other organs. Both kidneys were normal sized without apparent abnormalities.\nEndoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) revealed a 2-cm adenoma-like protruding lesion in the ampulla of Vater. EUS showed a well-defined isoechoic homogeneous mass without bile or pancreatic duct invasion (-). The mass was resected using a snare and a plastic stent was inserted into the bile duct; insertion of a plastic stent into the pancreatic duct failed.

The patient had no known history of seizure, recent illness, brain trauma, or recent surgical procedures.\nPhysical examination showed a male in no acute distress with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 12 (eyes, 4; verbal, 3; motor, 5). There were no signs of trauma found on his body. His pupils were equally round and reactive to light, and his neck was supple and soft with a cervical collar in place. Cardiopulmonary examination was unremarkable except for tachycardia. Abdominal examination was unremarkable. Because he was not following commands, the neurologic examination was limited. However, the patient was able to move all extremities equally and pulses were distally equal to all extremities. There was no posturing or clonus noted, and Babinski was downgoing in both feet.\nFingerstick glucose level was 210 mg/dL and bedside hemoglobin level was 13.1 g/dL. Noncontrast head and cervical spine computed tomography revealed no acute pathologic lesion. Chest radiography also showed no acute pathologic lesion. Laboratory tests showed white blood cell counts of 5.5 K/mm3 with 60% neutrophils, hematocrit of 36.5%, and platelets of 115 K/mm3. Electrolyte and liver function results were as follows: sodium, 141 mmol/L; potassium, 3.5 mmol/L; chloride, 104 mmol/L; bicarbonate, 22 mmol/L; calcium, 9.3 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 71 mmol/L; creatinine, 1.9 mg/dL; total bilirubin, 2.1 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase, 128 U/L; alanine aminotransferase, 124 U/L; alkaline phosphatase, 231 U/L; albumin, 4.0 g/dL; lipase, 30 U/L; prothrombin time, 14.5 seconds; INR, 1.09; and ammonia, 501 \u03bcmol/L (reference range, 15\u201355 \u03bcmol/L). Toxicology serum screen results were negative for acetaminophen, salicylate, and ethanol. Urine toxicology screen results were positive only for opiates. Venous blood gas was pH 7.44.\nOwing to the patient's obtunded condition and inability to protect his airway, the patient was electively intubated and given midazolam drip for sedation. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for monitoring with a presumed diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy. While administration of empiric antibiotics was started in the emergency department, it was discontinued after an infectious etiology was deemed unlikely and culture results were negative. Results of a magnetic resonance imaging brain scan were also negative, including no evidence of infarct.\nDuring the ICU stay, the patient was readministered lactulose, and ammonia levels decreased to117 \u03bcmol/L by hospital day 2 and to 78 \u03bcmol/L by hospital day 4. Despite discontinuation of sedation, the patient remained unresponsive. A neurologist was consulted and a bedside electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed findings consistent with status epilepticus. However, the patient had no clinical manifestations of status epilepticus, leading to a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. A phenytoin load was immediately administered, while a midazolam infusion was restarted, ultimately leading to EEG resolution of the status epilepticus. The patient did not immediately improve neurologically during the hospitalization stay and was ultimately transferred to another facility for continued treatment and rehabilitation.", "Question": "What is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L?", "LLM Answer": "15.0", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "15", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 141.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 141.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 141.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 141.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 141.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 141.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 104.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 104.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 104.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 104.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 104.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 104.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 22.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 22.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 22.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 22.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 22.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 22.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 141.0 mEq/L - (104.0 mEq/L + 22.0 mEq/L) = 15.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 15.0 mEq/L.\nThe concentration of albumin is 4.0 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 15.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 4.0 (in g/dL)) = 15.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 15.0 mEq/L.", "Result": "Correct"}

In addition, she observed leaking and drainage around her G-tube site with associated erythema and intense abdominal pain. The patient denied sick contacts or recent travel.\nHer past medical history includes obesity, orthostatic hypotension, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease, nephrolithiasis, gastrojejunal ulcer, Kawasaki\u2019s disease, subdural hemorrhage, epilepsy, chronic pain syndrome, and anxiety. The patient\u2019s past surgical history includes burr-hole craniotomy, lithotripsy, cholecystectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass complicated by chronic refractory marginal ulceration and small bowel obstruction requiring two resections, ventral hernia repair, and gastrostomy tube insertion.\nThe patient was pregnant six times and had six miscarriages (G6P0060). She lives with her husband and adopted son with good social support. She is currently unemployed. The patient denies ever smoking and does not drink alcohol. Familial history consists of diabetes, heart disease, and nephrolithiasis in the patient\u2019s mother. Her father had glaucoma, nephrolithiasis, and prostate cancer.\nMedications before admission included pantoprazole 40 mg twice a day, sucralfate 1 g twice a day, ondansetron 4 mg twice a day as needed for nausea, midodrine 10 mg three times a day, fludrocortisone 0.1 mg twice a day, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, levetiracetam 1500 twice a day, methadone 10 mg every 8 hours, and lorazepam 0.5 mg daily as needed for anxiety. She was also on daily vitamin A, D3, and B-complex supplements and a monthly cyanocobalamin 1000 \u03bcg intramuscular injection, in addition to a nutritional supplement Isosource 1.5 Cal that is administered through the G-tube once every night.\nDue to her complex past surgical history, the patient was sent from her local emergency department to our hospital. At presentation, the patient was febrile to 101 \u2109. Blood pressure was 110/72 mmHg, and heart rate was 84 beats per minute. Further examination revealed diffuse abdominal tenderness with erythema and purulent drainage around the G-tube site on the left upper quadrant. The general examination showed a thin patient who is alert and oriented. Mucous membranes were moist. Lungs were clear to auscultation as she was breathing comfortably on room air. Heart sounds were regular without murmurs. Extremities were warm with intact pulses bilaterally and no edema. However, she had moderate muscle loss for her age. Skin was intact except for the previously mentioned erythema around the G-tube. Neurological examination revealed normal speech with comprehension, intact cranial nerves II\u2013VII, XI, and XII, and 5/5 motor strength in all four extremities. Sensation was intact to light touch and pinprick throughout. Romberg test was negative. Gait was slowed owing to weakness but showed normal balance.\nSerum chemistry showed sodium of 136 mmol/L, potassium of 2.9 mmol/L, chloride of 111 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 20 mmol/L, magnesium 1.2 mg/dL, calcium 6.1 mg/dL, and serum creatinine 1.0 mg/dL. Liver function tests showed low albumin of 2.5 g/dL, total bilirubin of 0.3 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase of 86 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 13 U/L and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 21 U/L. Complete blood count showed a white blood cell count of 3.97 \u00d7 109 /L, hemoglobin of 12.6 g/dL, hematocrit of 39.6%, and platelet count of 239 \u00d7 109 /L. Urinalysis showed normal appearance and color, specific gravity of 1.020, without detecting red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), ketones, glucose, leukocytes esterase, or nitrites. A stool sample was sent for Clostridium difficile and a molecular enteric panel but was pending at that time. Two out of two blood cultures that were collected at her local emergency department were positive for Gram-negative rods. An abdominal radiograph confirmed G-tube location overlying the stomach and a computed tomography (CT) abdomen/pelvis with contrast showed nonspecific skin thickening and subcutaneous fat stranding along the G-tube insertion site (Fig. ). Due to a prior history of penicillin and sulfa anaphylactic reactions, the patient was empirically treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin 400 mg every 8 hours for bacteremia, and oral clindamycin 450 mg every 8 hours for the cellulitis surrounding her G-tube site, in addition to intravenous fluid resuscitation with normal saline at 75 mL/hour and electrolyte repletion with oral potassium chloride 20 mEq for four total doses, and intravenous magnesium sulfate 4 g once.\nA fluoroscopy G-tube study revealed no contrast leak or evidence of obstruction. On day 1 of hospitalization, the molecular enteric stool panel was positive for the Salmonella species. On day 4, two out of two blood cultures grew Salmonella enteritidis with susceptibilities to ampicillin, ceftriaxone, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The patient was then transitioned from intravenous ciprofloxacin to a 14-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g every 24 hours. We resumed tube feeds through the G-tube on day 5 after a successful clamping trial. On day 6, the patient was somnolent and difficult to arouse, with poor skin turgor and dry mucous membranes. Vital signs remained within normal limits; T max of 98.6 \u2109, blood pressure of 98/65 mmHg, and heart rate of 95 beats per minute. Laboratory results were significant for a serum creatinine level of 5.25 mg/dL and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis with sodium of 131 mmol/L, chloride of 105 mmol/L, and serum bicarbonate of 18 mmol/L. These clinical and laboratory findings of dehydration suggested the development of prerenal acute kidney injury (AKI) in the setting of prolonged GI volume loss. The patient was resuscitated with half normal saline containing 75 mEq sodium bicarbonate additive at 125 mL/hour. On day 8, the patient\u2019s mental status improved but her G-tube began to leak, prompting clamping of the G-tube. The patient was encouraged to increase oral intake. Intravenous fluids were discontinued on day 9, as she was able to tolerate oral foods and liquids well. No further leakage was seen around her G-tube site. On day 13, the patient was discharged home with a peripherally inserted central line to finish a 14-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone (2 g every 24 hours).\nFollowing completion of a 14-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone, the patient made a full recovery with resolution of her diarrhea and abdominal pain. Tube feeds were resumed without further issues. At a 4-month follow-up visit with her bariatric surgeon, the patient reports that she is doing well and happy with her progress. Electrolytes and serum creatinine were all within normal limits. The patient was readmitted 6 months following her initial hospitalization for abdominal pain and hematemesis due to a large marginal ulcer. She improved with conservative measures including bowel rest (nothing per os) and maintenance intravenous fluids, and was discharged 2 days later.

A 22G epidural catheter was passed into the epidural space and fixed at 9 cm. The time taken for onset of the subarachnoid block was approximately 5-6 min and the highest level of the block (T8) was achieved within 13 min. During the procedure, which lasted for 120 min, 1.5 L of ringer lactate was infused and normal saline was avoided. IV sodium bicarbonate and potassium supplementation were given based on ABG findings so as to maintain pH of more than 7.3 and >3 -5 mEq/L. A total of 50 meq of 7.5% sodium bicarbonate and 10 meq of potassium chloride were infused. Intraoperative vitals were stable, blood loss was approximately 300 ml, and urine output was 20-40 ml/h. For postoperative analgesia, a bolus of 8 ml of 0.2% ropivacaine (after a test dose of 3 ml of 2% lignocaine without epinephrine) was given epidurally and an infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine was started at 6 ml/h. The operation on the contralateral femur was done under epidural anesthesia 2 days later. Postoperatively, ECG was continuously monitored and ABG analysis was done twice a day for 3 days. Oral bicarbonate and potassium supplements were continued and additional IV supplementation was given as required.

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 133.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 133.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 133.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 133.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 133.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 122.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 122.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 122.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 122.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 122.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 122.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 11.3 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 11.3 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 11.3 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 11.3 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 11.3 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 11.3 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 133.0 mEq/L - (122.0 mEq/L + 11.3 mEq/L) = -0.3 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is -0.3 mEq/L.\nThe concentration of albumin is 3.2 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. Let's first convert the mass of albumin from mg to g. The mass of albumin is 3.2 mg. To convert 3.2 mg of albumin to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 3.2 mg albumin * 0.001 g/mg = 0.003 g albumin. The volume units is dL so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 3.2 mg albumin/dL converts to 0.003 g albumin/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get -0.3 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 0.003 (in g/dL)) = 9.692 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 9.692 mEq/L.", "Result": "Incorrect"}

Urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine. Arterial blood gas showed a pH 7.33, paCO2 68.5 and paO2 88.6 on FiO2 of 40%. Electrocardiogram confirmed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Echocardiogram revealed a myopathic severely enlarged left ventricular chamber with moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and severe global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 8 to 10%. The patient's work of breathing and oxygenation improved with Bipap. He was started on diltiazem and diuresis was initiated. The patient was admitted to the step-down unit with a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation.\nOn hospital day number eight, the overnight nurse found the patient unresponsive. A code blue was called. His initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation and he was shocked with 200 J twice before regaining pulses. When stabilised, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) where he regained consciousness and full neurologic function within one hour of the event. The following day, an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) was placed. Intraoperatively, the patient had runs of ventricular tachycardia with hypotension to 80 mmHg systolic. Postoperatively, the patient was found to have a right fixed mid-dilated pupil, flaccid paralysis of the left arm and leg with hyperreflexia throughout the left side. Computed tomography (CT) of the head revealed a right midbrain and thalamic stroke thought to be secondary to transient arrhythmia-induced hypoperfusion, intraoperatively.\nOn postoperative day number three, after AICD placement and stroke, the patient acutely developed a rigid distended board-like abdomen with dullness to percussion. Vitals at that time were temperature, 98.4 degrees Fahrenheit; blood pressure, 112/67 mmHg; heart rate range, 55 beats per minute, and respiratory rate 26 on ventilator settings of assist control volume control with a rate of 26; tidal volume, 500 ml; FiO2, 40% and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5. His peak inspiratory pressure on the ventilator had risen from 26 to 72 mmHg; his plateau had risen from 15 to 48 mmHg with oxygen desaturation from 93 to 85%. The patient had received 1.5 l in and urinated 4.5 l over the 24 hours, leading up to this event. His laboratory values from that morning were unchanged from previous (white blood count, 10 400/\u03bcl; haemoglobin, 12.6 g/dl; platelets, 200 000/\u03bcl; sodium, 139 mEq/l; potassium, 4.7 mEq/l; chloride, 100 mEq/l; bicarbonate, 34 mEq/l; BUN, 36 mg/dl; creatinine, 1.41 mg/dl; glucose, 78 mg/dl; calcium, 8.3 mg/dl; magnesium, 2.0 mEq/l; phosphorus, 3.0 mg/dl; AST, 77 U/l; ALT, 94 U/l; alkaline phosphatase, 186 U/l; total bilirubin, 1.3 mg/dl). This constellation of findings prompted the team to measure an abdominal compartment pressure which was elevated to 53 cm H2O (40 mmHg) with an abdominal perfusion pressure (APP) of 42 mmHg. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed which showed no dilated loops of bowel, no ileus, no evidence of free air, abscess or obstruction and minimal free fluid []. Pertinent labs from the event revealed a lactate of 1.0 mg/dl; lipase, 159 U/l; amylase, 76 U/l; creatinine, 1.53 mg/dl. Surgery was consulted and the FiO2 was increased to 100%, which improved his oxygen saturation to 96% despite his elevated peak inspiratory pressures.\nSurgical recommendations were for an emergent bedside surgical abdominal decompression. The patient was administered 10 mg of intravenous cisatracurium besylate by anaesthesia in preparation for surgical management. Shortly following paralytic administration, his peak inspiratory pressure corrected from 72 to 23 mmHg, his plateau pressure from 48 to 16 mmHg and his oxygenation status tolerated a decrease in FiO2 down to 40% with his oxygen saturation returning to baseline. Measurement of his abdominal compartment pressure revealed a drop from 53 (40 mmHg) to 23 cm H2O (17 mmHg) and then normalised to 15 cm H20 (11 mmHg) over a three-hour period. During this entire event, the patient averaged 100 to 200 cc/hr of urine output and laboratory values from the following day showed a drop in creatinine from 1.53 to 1.29 mg/dl. Given this correction, surgical management was postponed and the patient was monitored. The patient remained hospitalised for an additional 73 days.

No genetic testing was done on his brother.\nOn initial examination, the patient was stable but hypertensive with blood pressure reading of 136/83 mmHg, generalized oedema and a distended abdomen. No other abnormalities detected in systemic examinations. Laboratory investigations were performed and revealed the following: serum creatinine (45 \u00b5mol/L; normal 2.6\u201352.2 \u00b5mol/L), blood urea nitrogen (14.1 mmol/L; normal 1.8\u20136.4 mmol/L), potassium (5.5 mmol/L), sodium (135 mmol/L), chloride (110 mmol/L), bicarbonate (18 mmol/L), albumin (1.2 g/dL; normal 3.4-4.2 g/dL), haemoglobin (Hgb) (5.2 g/dL; normal 11.5\u201314.5 g/dL), white blood cell (WBC) count (9.13 \u00d7 109/L; normal 4\u201312 \u00d7 109/L), platelet count (23 \u00d7 109/L; normal 150\u2013400 \u00d7 109/L), haptoglobin (< 0.058 g/L; normal 0.5\u20132.2 g/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (1425 U/L; normal 150\u2013500 U/L), complement C3 (C3) (0.550 g/L; normal 0.80\u20131.60 g/L), and complement C4 (C4) (0.109/L; normal 0.16\u20130.48 g/L). The patient also had normal coagulation profile, normal level of ADAMTS13, negative coombs test and peripheral blood smears showed schistocytes. His urine dipstick showed urine protein excretion of > 400 mg/dL and 20\u201350 red blood cells/high power field. Stool cultures and analysis revealed no pathogens (Table ). Due to his uncontrolled hypertension and thrombocytopenia, the patient could not undergo a kidney biopsy.\nThe patient\u2019s clinical picture fit the diagnosis of aHUS, and eculizumab was started within 24 h of the diagnosis. Following the recommendations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the manufacturer, he was given a 600 mg intravenous (IV) infusion as induction therapy and a 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks as maintenance therapy. After two doses of eculizumab, he started to show clinical and laboratory improvement. His Hgb improved to 9 g/dL; his platelet count increased to 169 \u00d7 109/L; and his C3, haptoglobin, and LDH levels were normalized (Table ). His blood pressure was controlled on amlodipine and lisinopril, and his oedema significantly improved. A genetic panel for aHUS was performed, and the patient showed a homozygous nonsense gene mutation in DGKE p.(Phe250Serfs*3). No mutation was detected in the gene coding regions of ADAMTS13, C3, CD46, CFB, CFH, CFHR1, CFHR2, CFHR3, CFHR5, CFI, MMACHC, PIGA, PLG, THBD, CD59, CR1, CR2, INF2, or MUT.\nSix months after presentation, the patient was stable and in clinical remission on eculizumab 300 mg every other week. His laboratory parameters were within the normal ranges (Hgb 11.8 g/dL, platelet count 543 \u00d7 109/L, C3 0.9 g/L) apart from persistent moderate proteinuria, with urine dipstick 100 mg/dL and serum albumin 2.5 g/dL (Table ). Based on the genetic results and the patient\u2019s general condition, we decided to start increasing the time between eculizumab doses, targeting discontinuation. A 300 mg IV infusion of eculizumab was administered every three weeks instead of every two weeks. Following the first dose after increasing the time between doses, the patient was noticed to be oedematous; his proteinuria in urine dipstick increased to 400 \u2212 300 mg/dL with urine protein/creatinine ratio > 3 mg/mg, his albumin dropped to 1.9 g/dL, and other laboratory parameters, including Hgb and platelet count, were within the normal ranges (Hgb 12.2 g/dl and platelet count 494 \u00d7 109/L) (Table ). His oedema improved after the addition of oral furosemide at 1 mg/kg/dose twice daily. Nevertheless, after 4 months of eculizumab every 3 weeks, the patient\u2019s proteinuria and albumin levels did not improve. The decision was made to try eculizumab every two weeks and observe his proteinuria. Interestingly, his proteinuria improved to 100 mg/dL after only two doses of the two-week regimen, his oedema subsided and serum albumin improved gradually from 1.9 g/L to 2.2 g/L (Table ). Four months later, patient is stable on eculizumab 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks with no oedema and stable proteinuria and Albumin (Table ). Throughout his first year after presentation, apart from proteinuria, his creatinine was within the normal range, and he had no signs of HUS activity after the first remission.", "Question": "What is the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L?", "LLM Answer": "10.4", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "2", "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.\nThe formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 135.0 mmol/L.

She presented in the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath (SOB). Her shortness of breath was getting progressively worse starting two days prior to admission. She denied any fevers, chills, sick contacts, nausea, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. She specified that she had actually been drinking a lot more water than regular prior to admission.\nOn admission, her vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 101/73 mmHg, a heart rate of 91 beats/min, a temperature of 37.4 degree Celsius, and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min. Her body mass index (BMI) was 18.6 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed a sick-appearing woman in severe respiratory distress using accessory muscles. She had a dry mucous membrane with poor skin turgor. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nOn laboratory assessment, the hemoglobin was 11.9 mg/dl, leukocyte count 3.6/mm3, serum creatinine 0.8 mg/dl, potassium 3.3 mmol/L, chloride 110 mmol/L, sodium 148 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 6 mmol/L. She had high anion gap metabolic acidosis (AGMA), (anion gap (AG) = 22). Her serum albumin on admission was 4.2 g/L, urine analysis revealed 80 mg/dl ketones, and serum lactate was 1.9 mmol/L. Furthermore, her liver enzymes revealed aspartate aminotransferase (AST) = 48 units/l, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) = 82 units/l, and alkaline phosphatase 199 units/l. Additionally, her blood glucose level was 133 mg/dl, salicylates = 6.8 mg/dl, and acetaminophen level was <2.0 ug/ml. Her blood alcohol level was normal and chest X-ray (CXR) on admission did not show any sign of acute cardiopulmonary problems.\nBased on the initial evaluation, she received stoma suctioning and was placed on high O2 via a tracheostomy mask. Her history of laryngeal cancer, mild tachycardia and hypoxia raised the suspicion of pulmonary embolism, so a chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) was ordered. The chest CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed mild emphysema.\nIn addition to that, an arterial blood gas (ABG) test was done, which revealed a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) as presented in Table . The patient continued to hyperventilate to compensate for the acidosis and was subsequently intubated.\nDifferential diagnoses including carbon monoxide poisoning, aminoglycoside toxicity, methanol, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), alcoholic ketosis, acetaminophen toxicity, iron ingestion, lactic acidosis, ethanol toxicity, salicylate toxicity, and aspirin ingestion were investigated. However, given the patient's normal acetaminophen, salicylate, lactic acid, and ethanol levels, these etiologies were ruled out. Furthermore, serum osmolality was normal and the osmolal gap was less than 10. Our differential diagnosis was further narrowed due to the presence of elevated ketones. Given the patient's malnourished state, the most likely cause of HAGMA in this patient was starvation ketosis. The patient was started on 5% dextrose water and sodium bicarbonate drip, and tube feeds. The ABG level swiftly improved within three days and she was extubated.\nAfter four days of intensive care unit (ICU) course, she was downgraded and later on discharged after detailed counseling from a nutritionist regarding a balanced diet and avoiding fasting.

Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 4.2 g albumin/10.0 dL = 0.42 g albumin/dL. The concentration value of 4.2 g albumin/L converts to 0.42 g albumin/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 32.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 0.42 (in g/dL)) = 40.95 mEq/L.

Ultrasound of the liver was performed and showed no significant abnormality in the liver, gallbladder or pancreas. There was no sign of gallstone or pericholecystic fluid formation. Abdominal computed tomography with contrast showed only mild fatty changes of the liver.\nWhile the patient was in the hospital, ultrasound-guided liver biopsy was done; she was started on oral prednisone 60 mg daily and discharged home on that dose awaiting the liver biopsy result.

After admission, the patient developed a watery diarrhea. In addition to food refusal, he was observed to produce lesser urine than usual upon void review. His medical and birth history were unremarkable (he was not administered any medications, he had no known allergies, and his immunizations were up to date). His family medical history was unremarkable, and he had no travel history at that time.\nUpon examination, the patient looked acutely ill and dehydrated. He was 90.2 cm (in the 75\u201385th percentile) tall and weighed 11.6 kg (in the 15\u201325th percentile). His abdomen was soft and flat with normoactive bowel sounds. Upon palpation of the abdomen the examination revealed the existence of a mild tenderness over the entire abdomen, without rebound tenderness or muscle guarding or rigidity. The rest of his physical examination was noted to be normal. The patient's vital signs showed a heart rate of 141 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 with a normal respiratory pattern, temperature of 38.6\u00b0C, and oxygen saturation at 98% on room air. He was observed to be mentally alert at the time of the examination.

All other blood tests were within the reference range. His stool occult blood test was positive (748 ng/mL). It is noted that the tests for rotavirus and norovirus antigen were negative. An erect chest X-ray did not show pneumoperitoneum; however, an erect abdominal X-ray demonstrated abnormal dilatation of the small bowel loops with air-fluid levels suggestive of possible SBO (). The abdominal ultrasonography revealed mild wall thickening of the small bowel loops suggestive of acute enteritis, several enlarged lymph nodes in the right lower quadrant, and a normal-appearing proximal appendix (the tip of the appendix was not visualized), without any evidence of mechanical bowel obstruction such as an intussusception.\nThe patient was resuscitated using normal saline and received conservative management. At that time, cefotaxime was empirically administered intravenously. The following day, his condition rapidly deteriorated, and he developed a state of septic shock. Upon examination, the patient's vital signs now were: blood pressure (BP) 87/39 mmHg, heart rate 170 bpm, respiratory rate 56, temperature 38.1\u00b0C, and oxygen saturation 93% on room air. Our surgical team urgently came to the patient and performed physical examination; his abdomen was soft with mild tenderness and slight muscle guarding on palpation. They recommended continuing medical supportive care, but frequent physical examinations needed to be performed to detect subtle changes in the patient's signs and symptoms. The patient's laboratory tests were repeated and revealed: WBCs 5,300 cells/\u03bcL, Hb 9.7 g/dL, platelets 186,000/\u03bcL, CRP 28.96 mg/dL, sodium 129 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, chloride 95 mmol/L, and albumin 2.6 g/dL.

The patient's venous blood gas analysis demonstrated metabolic acidosis: pH 7.28 and bicarbonate 15 mmol/L. Upon review, other blood tests remained within reference range. A plain abdominal X-ray was repeated and showed worsening of small bowel ileus. At that time, an urgent contrast-enhanced abdominal CT was performed in order to confirm the presence of a surgical abdomen. The imaging revealed diffuse dilatation of the large and small bowel loops (suggestive of paralytic ileus) with uniform enhancement of bowel wall and no lead point of bowel obstruction, mesenteric lymphadenitis, and mild ascites (). However, the radiologists were of the view that obstructive ileus could not be completely ruled out in this case. They did not find an abnormal appendix, but the condition of an acute appendicitis could not be excluded either. The patient was maintained on a nil per os status, and fluid resuscitation was continued. We tried rectal tube decompression, however, his condition did not show much improvement except the passage of small amount of rectal gas. He received albumin, packed red blood cells, and fresh frozen plasma intravenously. At that time, Metronidazole was additionally administered empirically, and his vital signs were closely monitored for any significant changes.\nOn the third hospital day, the patient became more lethargic despite medical therapy. His BP was observed to have normalized; however, it was noted that tachycardia and tachypnea persisted. On repeated physical examination, his abdomen now showed distention with hypoactive bowel sounds, however, muscle guarding or tenderness could not be clearly ascertained on palpation. The patient developed generalized edema and oliguria. Based on the patient's clinical condition, we decided to perform an urgent exploratory laparotomy at 44 hours after admission.\nUpon opening the peritoneum, approximately 400 mL of ascitic fluid was drained. Next, a segment of markedly dilated and infarcted small bowel was identified 30 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve (). It is noted that the total length of the necrotic small bowel was approximately 60 cm. The omentum and the colon appeared to be intact. Upon review, the small bowel intussusception or volvulus was not identified. Even at laparotomy, our surgical team could not find the lead point of bowel obstruction. The appendix appeared unremarkable macroscopically. In this case, after decompression of the bowel following an incision on an infarcted small bowel segment, 110 cm of the distal small bowel containing the necrotic segment was resected and end-to-end small bowel anastomosis was performed in addition to a prophylactic appendectomy.\nHistopathological examination of the surgical specimen revealed multiple areas of mucosal necrosis with diffuse congestion. The patient blood cultures did not reveal any bacteria, and stool cultures did not reveal Salmonella or Shigella. His postoperative course was considered to be uneventful, and oral nutrition could be initiated on postoperative day 5. The patient was discharged in a good general condition on postoperative day 11.

Hence, the concentration value of 15.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 15.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 129.0 mEq/L - (95.0 mEq/L + 15.0 mEq/L) = 19.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 19.0 mEq/L.\nThe concentration of albumin is 2.6 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 19.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 2.6 (in g/dL)) = 22.5 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 22.5 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 22.5 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 22.5 - 12 = 10.5 mEq/L.

There was no improvement with aggressive oral potassium supplementation in amounts up to 120 meq per day. The patient's serum potassium level normalized on three occasions when he was hospitalized and given supplemental potassium (COPD exacerbations in 7/06 and 1/07, pseudoseizures in 7/07), but the hypokalemia promptly recurred after discharge from the hospital (Figure ).

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mg to mEq. The mass of sodium is 137.0 mg. To convert from 137.0 mg to mEq, first convert from mg to mmol.To convert 137.0 mg of sodium to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 137.0 mg sodium * 0.001 g/mg = 0.137 g sodium. To convert from grams of sodium to moles, divide by the molar mass 22.99 g/mol, which will give 0.137 g/(22.99 g sodium/mol) = 0.006 mol sodium. To convert 0.006 mol of sodium to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.006 mol sodium * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 6.0 mmol sodium. To convert from 6.0 mmol sodium to mEq, multiply the mmol amount by the valence, to get 6.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 6.0 mEq sodium. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mEq/L. This will result to 6.0 mEq sodium/0.1 L = 60.0 mEq sodium/L. The concentration value of 137.0 mg sodium/dL converts to 60.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 95.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 95.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 95.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 95.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 95.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 95.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 30.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 30.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 30.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 30.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 30.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 30.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 60.0 mEq/L - (95.0 mEq/L + 30.0 mEq/L) = -65.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is -65.0 mEq/L.\nThe concentration of albumin is 3.6 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get -65.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 3.6 (in g/dL)) = -64.0 mEq/L.

Computerized tomography of the abdomen showed hepatosplenomegaly and periaortic lymphadenopathy. Doppler ultrasonography of the kidneys was normal.\nA percutaneous renal biopsy was performed. Light microscopy showed increased cellularity in all glomeruli and accentuation of lobular architecture. Silver staining showed double contours within the capillary loops. Epithelial crescents were not present. Immunofluorescence studies showed granular staining in a lobular pattern for IgG, IgM, Kappa, and lambda. Electron microscopy showed subendothelial and mesangial fine electron dense deposits (Figure ). These histologic changes were consistent with MPGN, type 1. There was no evidence of lymphomatous infiltration and there was no histological evidence of cyroglobulin deposition or amyloidosis.\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy showed a hypercellular bone marrow (80%) with extensive infiltration of small B cell lymphoctyes.

He had been prescribed amlodipine 2.5 mg for hypertensive medication. He also underwent radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer two years earlier. He underwent pelvic MRI using gadoterate meglumine (15 mL), immediately after iodide contrast-enhanced chest and abdomen computed tomography (CT) for cancer surveillance. Thirty days before CT scan, his creatinine level was 1.28 mg/dL and his estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 58 mL/min/1.73 m2. After 185 days, he visited a local clinic because of edematous changes in both lower extremities. CT angiography of the lower extremities was performed; no stenosis or occlusion of vessels was observed. Although diuretics were administered for 2 weeks, the edema worsened and was accompanied by pruritus and pain (). Eventually, he was referred to our hospital for further evaluation.\nUpon admission, his body temperature was 36.8\u00b0C and his blood pressure was 110/60 mmHg. His height was 161.3 cm, weight was 53.2 kg and body mass index was 20.4 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed grade 2+ pretibial pitting edema with redness, mild heat, and tenderness in both lower extremities. Both inguinal lymph nodes were not enlarged.\nInitial laboratory findings at admission (about 210 days after MRI scan) were as follows: white blood cell count, 6,200 /\u03bcL (neutrophil 66%, lymphocyte 22%, monocyte 10.3%, eosinophil 0.5%); hemoglobin, 10.7 g/dL; platelet, 253,000 /\u03bcL; blood urea nitrogen, 41 mg/dL; serum creatinine, 2.07 mg/dL; eGFR, 32 mL/min/1.73 m2; serum sodium, 134 mmol/L; potassium, 3.4 mmol/L; chloride, 102 mmol/L; total CO2, 20 mmol/L; calcium, 9.3 mg/dL; phosphate, 1.5 mg/dL; total protein, 6.9 g/dL; albumin, 4.0 g/dL; aspartate transaminase, 43 U/L; alanine aminotransferase, 15 U/L; and C-reactive protein, 0.96 mg/dL. Routine urine analysis revealed a pH of 6.0 and trace proteins. Red and white blood cells were absent in the urine. The spot urine protein/creatinine ratio was 209 mg/g and the spot urine albumin/creatinine ratio was 60 mg/g. Thyroid function tests were normal: thyroid stimulating hormone, 2.47 \u03bcIU/mL and free T4, 0.98 ng/dL. Fractional excretion of Na 0.1% and Fractional excretion of urea on admission was 17.6%, which suggested the patient was prerenal AKI.\nChest radiography and echocardiogram findings were normal. During doppler sonography of both lower extremities, the venous velocity was normal and there was no evidence of thrombosis. None of the aforementioned findings were suggestive of refractory edema.\nFluid therapy was administered to treat the AKI, which was probably caused by the diuretics he was given during his two-week stay in the local clinic. Subsequently, his renal function improved: serum creatinine, 1.18 mg/dL; and eGFR, 63.9 mL/min/1.73 m2. Since the redness and tenderness of both legs were suggestive of cellulitis-associated edema, intravenous cefazolin was administered for two weeks. However, the lesion gradually spread from his ankle to his thigh and changed into fibrotic induration. Contracture of the ankle and knee joints also occurred ().\nTo detect diffuse or localized systemic sclerosis, antinuclear antibody, anti-Scl 70 antibody, and anti-centromere antibody tests were performed, but the results were all negative. Also, eosinophilia and paraproteinemia was not seen, which is commonly accompanied in scleromyxedema or eosinophilic fasciitis. Although approximately 50 weeks had passed since he was exposed to the gadolinium, the characteristic clinical features led to the suspicion of NSF. A biopsy of the right anterior tibial skin lesion was performed to examine tissue for disease. This revealed unique features of the NSF such as dermal thickening with collagen fibers extending into the subcutaneous septa and a large number of spindle-shaped fibrocytes (). Neither eosinophilic tissue infiltration nor fat necrosis with calcification of adipocytes was found.\nSystemic methylprednisolone (20 mg/day) was administered for two weeks to treat the NSF. Additionally, UV-A1 topical phototherapy of 1.5 joule (J)/cm2 was administered to the lower leg lesion twice a week. The patient underwent intensive physical therapy including stretching, pneumatic compression, and Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation . We administered MTX 15 mg weekly while reducing the methylprednisolone dose weekly by half until a dose of 2 mg/day was administered. Simultaneously, the UV-A1 intensity was gradually increased to 3.0 J/cm2. After 6 months of treatment, the reddish edema improved and the skin induration decreased. Although the contracture of the ankles was still present (), there was no further disease progression.

Her blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg, heart rate 98 bpm, respiratory rate 20 times/minute and SpO\n2 98%. The urine culture was positive for\nEscherichia coli sensitive to cefoperazone sulbactam. Because of the progressive extremity pain, the patient was referred to the cardiothoracic and vascular surgery (CTS) division and, consistent with the first diagnosis, she was diagnosed with left dead limb and bilateral ALI (\n), and was advised to perform computed tomography angiography (CTA) and undergo an above-knee amputation. At day 9, the right lower extremity CTA (\n) discovered total occlusion due to 6 cm thrombus on right popliteal artery (from 1 cm above right femorotibial joint toward inferior). Right anterior tibial artery received contrast flow from collateral arteries and no contrast flow was seen in right posterior tibial, peroneal and dorsalis pedis arteries. Meanwhile, the left lower extremity CTA showed total occlusion due to 12.7 cm thrombus on left popliteal artery (from 6 cm above left femorotibial joint toward inferior).

She presented with end-stage renal disease (oliguria, anemia, and failure to thrive). She was the first child of healthy nonconsanguineous Thai parents. She was born at term to a 23-year-old mother and a 25-year-old father. Her prenatal and perinatal periods were uncomplicated. Her development was unremarkable until six months of age. She clawed by using her knees and elbows, instead of hands, at the age of 8 months. She was unable to walk on her feet but moved on her knees during her childhood period. She came to our hospital at the age of 12 years. Her weight was 25.4 kilograms (below the 3rd percentile) and her sitting height was 70 cm (below the 3rd percentile). Her vitals were normal, except high blood pressure at 120/80 mmHg (above 99th percentile for her age, sex, and height). She had pallor. Her distinctive facial features were the cloudy cornea, exophthalmos, underdeveloped ala nasi, maxillary hypoplasia, and micrognathia (). Upper extremity deformities included shortening of arms and forearms, flexion contracture of elbows, distorted wrists, and shortening of all fingers. Deformities of lower extremities were short thighs, short-bowed legs, and flexion contracture of knee. Distorted and restricted in motion of ankles, and deformities of feet were observed. Her heart, lungs, abdomen, and neurological examination were unremarkable. Her cognitive was appropriated with age.\nHer initial investigations demonstrated blood urea nitrogen 120 mg/dL, serum creatinine 8.3 mg/dL, Na 134, K 4.5, Cl 95, HCO3 11 mmol/L, phosphate 2.6, calcium 3.8 mg/dL, albumin 0.6 g/dL, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 13.5 U/L, with parathyroid hormone (PTH) level at 94 pg/ml. Her radiography of the upper extremities showed absence of carpal bones, osteolytic lesions of metacarpal, and distal ends of ulna and radial bones (). The radiography of the lower extremities demonstrated absence of tarsal bones, osteolytic lesions of metatarsal bones, and distal end of fibula (). In addition, severe cortical thinning of all bones indicating osteopenia was observed (Figures and ).\nUltrasonography showed small size of both kidneys and echocardiography demonstrated left ventricular hypertrophy. The diagnosis of end-stage renal disease was made with estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 7 mL/min/1.73 m2. All clinical presentation and investigations were compatible with the clinical diagnosis of MCTO. She received hemodialysis followed by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and medications including erythropoietin, ferrous fumarate, 0.50 \u00b5g of calcitriol, and 1400 mg of elemental calcium. Six months later, she developed generalized tonic-clonic seizure from hypercalcemia (12.4 mg/dL). Her serum chemistry demonstrated normal serum phosphorus level (3.9 mg/dL) and low serum alkaline phosphatase (4 U/L), with normal serum PTH level at 103 pg/mL. These findings indicated a marked reduction in the bone uptake of calcium after a period of calcium supplement. Calcium and calcitriol were discontinued until serum calcium returned to normal level, then only 720 mg of elemental calcium was reintroduced. Two years later, she had a slightly high serum calcium level (10.8 mg/dL), normal serum phosphorus level (3.5 mg/dL), and normal PTH level (113 pg/ml). Interestingly, during the past 2 years, we observed persistently low serum ALP levels (2.6\u20134.9 U/L) [], indicating poor osteoblastic activity and limited bone formation. Thus, impaired bone mineralization from dysregulation of osteoblast and osteoclast was suspected and MAFB mutation might be responsible for MCTO disease in this patient.\nWe performed a genetic testing, MAFB sequencing on her and her parental blood. The genomic were isolated from peripheral lymphocytes using Puregene DNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). A short region of the amino-terminal transcriptional activation domain of the MAFB gene, containing mutation hotspots, was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We designed primers by using software (Primer3Plus). The forward and reverse primer sequences for PCR amplification were 5\u2032-GCTCAAGT TCGACGTGAAGA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GTAGTTGCTCGCCATCCAGT-3\u2032, respectively. PCR products were visualized on a 2% agarose gel and purified using DyeEx 2.0 spin kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The products were then sequenced by capillary electrophoresis. This study was approved by the ethic committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Thammasat University, Thailand (MTU-EC-PE-1-005/59).\nWe identified a de novo heterozygous missense mutation at nucleotide 197 from C to G (NM_005461.4; c.197C > G; ), predicting the change of amino acid at codon 66 from serine to cysteine (p.Ser66Cys). There was negative in both mother and father's result. This missense mutation occurred within the transactivation domain of MafB protein. This serine at the codon 66 is evolutionarily conserved among species, and in silico prediction of pathogenicity programs classify this variant as deleterious (SIFT) and probably damaging (PolyPhen).", "Question": "What is the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L?", "LLM Answer": "-10.1", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "24.5", "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.\nThe formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 134.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 95.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 11.0 mmol/L.

His symptoms had begun 2 weeks prior to admission, with abdominal pain and an erythematous pinpoint rash on his arms. The rash developed from his upper limbs (opisthenar and arms) to his lower limbs. Laboratory examination in the outpatient clinic revealed no abnormalities in indicators such as white blood cell count, platelet count, and hemoglobin. After oral medication (specific unknown), his abdominal symptoms began to reduce, as did the purpura. Ten days prior, the rash progressed mostly on the legs, and he experienced deeper abdominal pain in the form of persistent pain with abdominal gassiness and emesis. He was admitted to another hospital with a diagnosis of HSP. Seven days prior, he had melena. After fasting and fluid replacement, there was no obvious improvement in the symptoms. Half a day prior, his face and lips appeared pale, and he had increased abdominal pain, accompanied by numerous bloody stools and hematemesis. He was immediately treated with methylprednisolone, posterior pituitary injection, somatostatin, and hemocoagulase, together with the infusion of large blood products (Table ). At this stage, the patient still produced large amounts of blood in the vomit and stool. His vital signs were extremely unstable, and he was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit of our hospital. The patient had purpura with lower limb predominance and abdominal pain (consistent with one of the following 4 criteria: abdominal pain, histopathology, arthritis or arthralgia, and renal involvement), and was diagnosed with HSP.[\nOn admission, he had severe anemia, with a blood pressure of 76/44 mm Hg, pulse of 135 beats/min, and respiratory rate of 25 breaths/min. There was also a palpable purpura rash on both legs, tenderness in the abdomen, and absence of bowel sounds. Routine blood examination revealed a hemoglobin level of 70 g/L, white blood cell count of 11.48 \u00d7 109/L, and platelet count of 13 \u00d7 109/L. The liver function test showed albumin 10 g/L. The serum electrolytes showed sodium 140 mmol/L, potassium 2.92 mmol/L, chloride 112.1 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 15.9 mmol/L (Table ) with coagulopathy. Therefore, HSP complicated with an alimentary tract hemorrhage was diagnosed. He was immediately treated with intravenous methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg per day), infusion of blood products, and somatostatin but after 2 days after treatment (day 3), he still had massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage, poor circulation, a reduced level of consciousness, and unstable vital signs. Abdominal ultrasonography and plain abdominal radiography revealed no enterobrosis. The patient was also evaluated by pediatric surgeons, and the continuation of medical treatment was suggested. However, his condition deteriorated, and he needed to rely on a life-supporting blood transfusion. He developed signs of peritonitis with abdominal distension. Gastrointestinal tract perforation was suspected. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the whole abdomen revealed curved liquid samples and gas shadows on the left and front of the stomach, supporting the possibility of gastrointestinal tract perforation (Fig. ). On day 4, an emergency laparotomy was performed. The surgery revealed that the anterior wall of the descending duodenum was thinner with a 1 cm \u00d7 1 cm diameter perforation, and the posterior wall had a 3 cm \u00d7 1 cm ulcer, which had penetrated into the peritoneum of the pancreas and experienced active bleeding from the broken end of the vessel. The intraoperative hemorrhage volume was approximately 3000 mL, including intragastric bleeding and intestinal blood clots. Pathological examination indicated chronic inflammation of the intestinal wall mucosa in the descending part of the stomach and duodenum, with hemorrhage, ulceration, interstitial congestion, and edema. Immunofluorescence microscopy of paraffin sections showed granular and lumpy IgA focal deposition in the blood vessel walls (Fig. ). Postoperatively, he was administered nasal continuous positive airway pressure-assisted ventilation, anti-infection treatment, albumin transfusion, platelet transfusion, abdominal drainage, methylprednisolone, fluconazole antifungal treatment, and wound dressing. The general symptoms gradually improved, vital signs were stable, and abdominal pain was relieved. The drainage tube was assessed after discharge, the abdominal CT was repeated after 1 month and the duodenostomy tube was removed 50 days after surgery.

His vitamin D levels had not been checked prior to the administration of Denosumab. After admission to the hospital, his vitamin D 25-OH level was low at 12.1 ng/mL and vitamin D 1,25 dihydroxy level was high at 95.4 pg/mL. His initial PTH level was high at 440.7 pg/mL.\nHe was started on 50,000 IU of ergocalciferol every 7 days, 2 mcg of calcitriol twice daily, and high doses of IV and oral calcium supplementation. Over the next 16 days, the patient received high doses of calcium carbonate; he was first started on 5 gm twice daily of calcium carbonate and 1337 mg of calcium acetate. Since the ionized calcium levels were consistently below 0.60 mmol/L, he was slowly increased to 10 gm twice daily of calcium carbonate and 3335 mg of calcium acetate thrice daily with meals.

His renal function kept worsening during his hospital stay and his creatinine reached 4.12 mg/dL. During workup for his renal failure, he was found to have hydronephrosis due to the spreading tumor. The options available were either placement of percutaneous nephrostomy tubes by interventional radiology to relieve the hydronephrosis and continued attempts at correction of his electrolytes via medical management or placement of a tunneled dialysis catheter and starting hemodialysis.

His wife called an ambulance and had him brought to our ED as she noticed he was short of breath for the prior 12 hours. He did not have any symptoms suggestive of a recent upper respiratory tract infection or gastroenteritis. He denied exposure to sick contacts, recent immunizations, or consumption of canned foods or beverages. He did have a past medical history significant for esophageal stricture (diagnosed 2 years before) for which he had been undergoing routine endoscopic balloon dilation (last attempt was 3 months before). He lived in a rural upstate New York county and had retired as a meat-cutter 15 years before. His only medications at the time were ferrous sulfate (324 mg daily), pantoprazole (40 mg twice daily), and a multivitamin. He did not have a history of tobacco smoking. He consumed approximately two standard drinks in a week. He had no known allergies. While in our ED, his vital signs were: temperature, 37 \u00baC (98.6 \u00baF); heart rate, 100\u2013110 beats per minute; blood pressure, 141/82 mmHg; and oxygen saturation 82% on room air and requiring 100% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) via facemask to maintain saturations above 96%. On physical examination, he was in marked respiratory distress but not toxic-appearing. He was awake but drowsy, oriented only to self. His pupils were equal and symmetrical with appropriate response to light. His extra-ocular movements were intact. There was no facial droop; there was no deviation of tongue or uvula. His gag reflex was impaired. He could move all four extremities spontaneously and on command. However, motor strength appeared to be symmetrically and mildly diminished in all extremities and accompanied by decreased tone. Diminished knee and ankle reflexes were noted bilaterally. He had a diminished flexor plantar response bilaterally. Sensation was grossly intact in his face, trunk, and extremities. Coordination was impaired in upper and lower extremities with dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesia. Gait was not assessed. He had no visible involuntary movements. His neck was supple without signs of meningismus. A cardiovascular examination was unremarkable, with normal heart sounds and equal symmetrical pulses in bilateral extremities. His abdominal, musculoskeletal, and skin examinations were unremarkable. Although he was hemodynamically stable, he became lethargic with stridor and progressive hypoxia. Given concern for airway protection, he was emergently intubated with a 7.5 mm endotracheal tube on first attempt and placed on mechanical ventilatory support. For intubation, he was administered 1.5 mg/kg of succinylcholine and 0.3 mg/kg of etomidate intravenously. Maintenance fluids (normal saline at 125 cc/hour) and empiric intravenous administration of ceftriaxone at a dose of 2 g every 24 hours (to cover for possible aspiration pneumonia) was initiated. He was transferred to our intensive care unit for further management. A nasopharyngolaryngoscopy revealed bilateral true vocal cord paralysis. After stabilization on a ventilator, he underwent a tracheostomy on day 3 of admission and was transitioned successfully to a tracheostomy collar. Following extubation, he had consistent and gradual recovery of mental status. This was not, however, accompanied by any progressive improvement in motor function. He continued to have vocal cord immobility and flaccid weakness of his extremities.\nOn presentation, laboratory testing revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count, 13,800 cells/\u03bcL; hemoglobin, 14.7 g/dl; platelet count, 235,000 cells/\u03bcL; sodium, of 143 mmol/L; potassium, 4.2 mmol/L; chloride, 105 mmol/L; glucose, 176 mg/dL; bicarbonate, 27 mmol/L; creatinine, 0.53 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 15 mg/dL; and calcium, 8.0 mg/dL. A hepatic function panel revealed a total protein level, 5.2 g/dL; serum albumin, 3.5 g/dL; total bilirubin, 0.5 mg/dl; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 18 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 21 U/L; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.08; creatine kinase, 127 U/L; and troponin I less than 0.015 ng/mL. Urine analysis demonstrated cloudy urine with specific gravity 1.018, pH 4.8, with 116 red blood cells (RBCs) and 4 white blood cells (WBCs), negative leukocyte esterase and nitrite. An electrocardiogram and chest X-ray were unremarkable. A urine drug screen and serum alcohol levels were negative. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and cortisol levels were within normal limits. Thiamine, vitamin B6, and B12 levels were normal. Serological tests were negative for Lyme disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), syphilis, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. Blood and urine cultures obtained at presentation showed no growth. Non-contrast computed tomography (CT) of his head and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his brain were normal except for mild ventriculomegaly (Fig. ). CT angiography of his head and neck revealed patent intracranial vasculature. A repetitive nerve stimulation electromyographic (EMG) study demonstrated patchy, moderate to severe, peripheral motor nerve denervation consistent with AIDP. A lumbar puncture was performed and analysis of the obtained cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed albuminocytologic dissociation with less than 3 nucleated cells per mL of fluid, elevated CSF protein of 62 mg/dl, and normal glucose levels (88 mg/dl). CSF cultures did not demonstrate any growth. Anti-GQ1B antibody and anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody levels were negative.\nA subacute presentation with ataxia, stridor with respiratory distress, and areflexia with weakness of bilateral upper and lower extremity offers a challenging differential (Table ).\nIt is prudent to first rule out an acute vascular cause such as stroke, especially involving the cerebellum and brainstem; for example, for example, an absence of any lateralizing neurological signs and disturbed consciousness would rule out stroke, especially one with brainstem involvement. Next, metabolic abnormalities due to alcoholism, vitamin deficiencies, or electrolyte deficiencies would be evident on a metabolic panel and on serum vitamin and ethyl alcohol levels. An absence of a suggestive history of exposure to Clostridium botulinum, such as consumption of canned or tinned foods, cosmetic use of botulinum toxin injection, or intravenous drug use, significantly lowers the possibility of botulism. An absence of fever and meningeal signs, and analysis of CSF obtained on lumbar puncture, can rule out meningitis and encephalitis. Spinal cord trauma and spinal shock in the initial stages would result in flaccid paralysis of extremities aside from obvious signs of trauma. Also, concomitant bulbar paralysis is highly unlikely. Overlapping autoimmune demyelinating syndromes such as Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) and Bickerstaff\u2019s brainstem encephalitis (BBE) must be considered. GBS is more likely to have a characteristic pattern of ascending paralysis. BBE is considered to lie on the same spectrum as MFS as it may present with ataxia and ophthalmoplegia and can have positive anti-GQ1b antibodies. However, BBE is characterized more by hyperreflexia and somnolence. New-onset MG can be suspected but, in our patient, motor involvement was patchy, the anti-AChR antibody test result was negative, and EMG was not suggestive of MG.\nBased on the above, a diagnosis of MFS involving the bulbar muscles was made and our patient was started on a 5-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin at a daily dose of 0.4 mg/kg body weight per day. Following completion of this course, he showed clinical improvement in phonation, overall muscle strength, as well as tone. Although he initially did require overnight ventilatory support through his tracheostomy, the need for this gradually diminished and he was weaned off the ventilator altogether.\nSubsequent follow-up laryngoscopies after 1, 2, and 4 weeks showed improvement in vocal cord abduction. His overall respiratory status also improved with decreasing oxygen requirement and decreased need for tracheostomy suctioning. He continued to have moderate pharyngeal dysphagia and required placement of a jejunostomy tube for feeding. His hospitalization was also complicated with development of aspiration pneumonia. He was eventually discharged to a skilled nursing facility on a tracheostomy collar and jejunostomy tube after a total of 6 weeks of hospitalization and subsequently discharged home after making suitable progress in physical rehabilitation. He continued to follow-up with the physical medicine and rehabilitation (PMR) out-patient clinic and remained tracheostomy-dependent at 6 months following hospitalization. He was able to ambulate with a walker at that time.", "Question": "What is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio?", "LLM Answer": "1.66", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "-0.0833", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the albumin corrected delta ratio is albumin corrected delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L).\nTo compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.\nThe formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 143.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 143.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 143.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 143.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 143.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 143.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 105.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 105.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 105.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 105.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 105.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 105.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 27.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 27.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 27.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 27.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 27.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 27.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 143.0 mEq/L - (105.0 mEq/L + 27.0 mEq/L) = 11.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 11.0 mEq/L.\nThe concentration of albumin is 3.5 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 11.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 3.5 (in g/dL)) = 12.25 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 12.25 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 12.25 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 12.25 - 12 = 0.25 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is 0.25 mEq/L.\nPlugging in the albumin corrected delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration into the albumin corrected delta ratio formula, we get 0.25 mEq/L / -3.0 mEq/L = -0.0833.

He is the offspring of parents in a consanguineous marriage with an unremarkable past medical history. He has one sister and three brothers. One of his brothers was diagnosed with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome due to membranous proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) with C3 deposition diagnosed by kidney biopsy at 3 years of age. He reached chronic kidney disease stage 5 at the age of 4 years. Dialysis was considered, but he died in another hospital due to sepsis. No genetic testing was done on his brother.\nOn initial examination, the patient was stable but hypertensive with blood pressure reading of 136/83 mmHg, generalized oedema and a distended abdomen. No other abnormalities detected in systemic examinations.

His urine dipstick showed urine protein excretion of > 400 mg/dL and 20\u201350 red blood cells/high power field. Stool cultures and analysis revealed no pathogens (Table ). Due to his uncontrolled hypertension and thrombocytopenia, the patient could not undergo a kidney biopsy.\nThe patient\u2019s clinical picture fit the diagnosis of aHUS, and eculizumab was started within 24 h of the diagnosis. Following the recommendations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the manufacturer, he was given a 600 mg intravenous (IV) infusion as induction therapy and a 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks as maintenance therapy. After two doses of eculizumab, he started to show clinical and laboratory improvement. His Hgb improved to 9 g/dL; his platelet count increased to 169 \u00d7 109/L; and his C3, haptoglobin, and LDH levels were normalized (Table ). His blood pressure was controlled on amlodipine and lisinopril, and his oedema significantly improved. A genetic panel for aHUS was performed, and the patient showed a homozygous nonsense gene mutation in DGKE p.(Phe250Serfs*3). No mutation was detected in the gene coding regions of ADAMTS13, C3, CD46, CFB, CFH, CFHR1, CFHR2, CFHR3, CFHR5, CFI, MMACHC, PIGA, PLG, THBD, CD59, CR1, CR2, INF2, or MUT.\nSix months after presentation, the patient was stable and in clinical remission on eculizumab 300 mg every other week.

Based on the genetic results and the patient\u2019s general condition, we decided to start increasing the time between eculizumab doses, targeting discontinuation. A 300 mg IV infusion of eculizumab was administered every three weeks instead of every two weeks. Following the first dose after increasing the time between doses, the patient was noticed to be oedematous; his proteinuria in urine dipstick increased to 400 \u2212 300 mg/dL with urine protein/creatinine ratio > 3 mg/mg, his albumin dropped to 1.9 g/dL, and other laboratory parameters, including Hgb and platelet count, were within the normal ranges (Hgb 12.2 g/dl and platelet count 494 \u00d7 109/L) (Table ). His oedema improved after the addition of oral furosemide at 1 mg/kg/dose twice daily. Nevertheless, after 4 months of eculizumab every 3 weeks, the patient\u2019s proteinuria and albumin levels did not improve. The decision was made to try eculizumab every two weeks and observe his proteinuria. Interestingly, his proteinuria improved to 100 mg/dL after only two doses of the two-week regimen, his oedema subsided and serum albumin improved gradually from 1.9 g/L to 2.2 g/L (Table ). Four months later, patient is stable on eculizumab 300 mg IV infusion every two weeks with no oedema and stable proteinuria and Albumin (Table ).

Nephrology was consulted early and after ruling out acute toxic nephropathy, urinary obstruction, and acute rhabdomyolsis, it was suspected, based on his initial positive toxicology screen for cocaine that he may have cocaine-induced interstitial nephritis and a renal biopsy was performed (see below). Indeed, on further questioning, the patient admitted to smoking crack cocaine. It was confirmed with the patient and his spouse that the cocaine was not mixed or combined with any other substance. At that point (day 4) the patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone at 125 mg every 6 hours as well as daily or every other day hemodialysis for a total of 6 sessions.

She reported that the rash developed over a period of 3 months with an intermittent response to prednisone therapy. Three weeks prior to presentation, the rash became progressively worse. She developed fevers came on one week prior to presentation. The rash started on her arms and progressively spread. She admitted associated shortness of breath accompanied by a productive cough with green, bloody sputum, as well as nausea and vomiting. Patient reported compliance with her home dose of prednisone but may have not taken her mycophenolate mofetil regularly. She missed two sequential hemodialysis sessions due to pain with walking from the blistering rash on her soles of the feet.\nHer physical exam was significant for fever of 100.6\u00b0F and tachycardia with heart rate of 130 beats per minute. Skin exam was evident for brown plaques on the forehead and bilateral cheeks with sparing of the nasolabial folds, with erosions and hemorrhagic crust involving the philtrum, ears, forehead, nose, chin, and lips. There were dark brown plaques with few erosions and atrophic scars on bilateral forearms and lower legs with deep red to violaceous painful targetoid lesions on the palms and plantar surfaces (Figures and ). The skin over the trunk had pink eroded macules, and there were pink patches on the back within a background of dusky necrotic plaques. There were multiple full-thickness epidermal necroses with large areas of bleeding with the denuded skin on the arms and chest in the sun exposed distribution (). Oral mucosae were negative for any oral lesions.\nPatient was found to be pancytopenic with white blood cell count (WBC) 2.03 (Ref: 3.4\u201310.8 \u00d7 103/UL), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.25 (Ref: 1.4\u20137.0 \u00d7 103/UL), hemoglobin (Hb) 8.8 g/dL (Ref: 11.1\u201315.9 g/dL), hematocrit (Hct) 28.9% (Ref: 34\u201346%), platelet 69 (150\u2013450 \u00d7 103/UL), sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 98 mmol/L, CO2 21 mmol/L, BUN 41 mg/dL (Ref: 6\u201320 mg/dL), Cr 5.49 mg/dL (Ref: 0.57\u20131.0 mg/dL), calcium 7.2 mg/dL (8.7\u201310.2 mg/dL), albumin 3.2 g/dL, phosphorous 5.0 mg/dL (Ref: 1.2\u20132.2 mg/dL), AST 286 IU/L (Ref 0\u201340 IU/L), ALT 31 IU/L (0\u201332 IU/L), total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 136 IU/L, CK 91 U/L, serum lactate was 0.80 mmol/L, and ferritin was 5885 ng/mL (Ref: 15\u201350 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray did not show any lung infiltrates or effusions. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not show an acute abdominal process, and the liver demonstrated normal echogenicity, echotexture, and size; the spleen was not enlarged. Sputum gram stain and cultures were unremarkable. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and yeast. Patient was anuric due to chronic dialysis. Evaluation of lupus activity showed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody 42 IU/mL (Ref: 0\u20139 IU/L). Complement 3 (C3) was 43 mg/dL (Ref: 90\u2013180 mg/dL) and complement 4 (C4) was 9 mg/dL (Ref: 10\u201340 mg/dL). Rheumatoid factor was negative.

Skin biopsies showed focal interface changes, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for fungal microorganisms. Gram stain highlighted surface cocci bacteria. VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus.\nGiven her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven\u2013Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3\u2013858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome.\nDue to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases.\nIt was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations.

The pulse is less than 125 beats per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping it at 45.0.\nThe patient's temperature is 34.0 degrees fahrenheit. To convert to degrees celsius, apply the formula 5/9 * [temperature (degrees fahrenheit) - 32]. This means that the patient's temperature is 5/9 * 2.0 = 1.111 degrees celsius.

To convert 17.0 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 17.0 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.017 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.017 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 3.063 g glucose.

The pulse is less than 125 beats per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping it at 108.\nThe patient's temperature is 99.5 degrees fahrenheit. To convert to degrees celsius, apply the formula 5/9 * [temperature (degrees fahrenheit) - 32]. This means that the patient's temperature is 5/9 * 67.5 = 37.5 degrees celsius.

The compound 140.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 140.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 140.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed.

To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.007 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 1.261 g glucose. To convert 1.261 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 1.261 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 1261.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L.

The pulse is less than 125 beats per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping it at 140.0.\nThe patient's temperature is 100.2 degrees fahrenheit. To convert to degrees celsius, apply the formula 5/9 * [temperature (degrees fahrenheit) - 32]. This means that the patient's temperature is 5/9 * 68.2 = 37.889 degrees celsius. The patient's temperature is greater than 35 degrees celsius and the temperature is less than 39.9 degrees celsius, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 140.0.\nThe patient's pH is 7.28.

We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 6.0 mmol. To convert 6.0 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 6.0 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.006 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.006 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 1.081 g glucose. To convert 1.081 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 1.081 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 1081.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 1081.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 108.1 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 6.0 mmol glucose/L converts to 108.1 mg glucose/dL.

The patient's BUN is greater than or equal to 30 mg/dL, and so we add 20 points to the score, making current total 169.0 + 20 = 189.0.\nThe concentration of sodium is 141.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 141.0 mEq. To convert from 141.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 141.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 141.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 141.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 141.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 141.0 mmol sodium/L. The patient's sodium is greater than or equal to 130 mmol/L, and so we do not add any points to the scor, keeping the total at 189.0.\nThe concentration of glucose is 8.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 8.0 mmol. To convert 8.0 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 8.0 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.008 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.008 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 1.441 g glucose. To convert 1.441 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 1.441 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 1441.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 1441.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 144.1 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 8.0 mmol glucose/L converts to 144.1 mg glucose/dL. The patient's glucose concentration is less than or equal to than 250 mg/dL, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 189.0.\nThe patient's hemocratit is 36.0 %. The patient's hemocratit is greater than or equal to 30%, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 189.0.\nThe patient's partial pressure of oxygen is 75.0 mm Hg. The patient's partial pressure of oxygen is greater than or equal to 60 mm Hg, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 189.0.\nThe patient's PSI score is 189.0.", "Result": "Incorrect"}
