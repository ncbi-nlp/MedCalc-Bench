Serologic tests were all negative for hepatitis A, B, C, and E. Computed tomography (CT) performed at admission revealed no distinct nodules or masses in the liver, but mild splenomegaly, multiple hypodense splenic lesions, and para-aortic lymph node swelling (Fig. a\u2013c). Antibiotics were administered intravenously for suspected acute cholangitis and sepsis, but the fever persisted. Abdominal ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed 2 days later newly depicted gallbladder wall thickening and ascites (Figs. , ). On the same night, the patient presented with grade II hepatic encephalopathy, with blood tests showing a decrease in platelet count and worsening liver function suggestive of \u201cacute type\u201d ALF with hepatic coma and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). While consideration was being given to treating acute liver failure, the patient suddenly developed ventricular fibrillation and died despite immediate resuscitation measures on day 3 of hospitalization.\nGiven the rapid clinical course, an autopsy was performed in this patient with suspected ALF likely due to drug-induced liver injury, autoimmune hepatitis, hepatitis of indeterminate etiology, circulatory disturbance, metabolic disease, or malignant cells including malignant lymphoma. This led to the patient being diagnosed with malignant, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, characterized by multiple lymph-node, as well as multi-organ (i.e., spleen, liver, lung, and prostate) involvement: (1) general swelling of lymph nodes in the para-abdominal aorta (Fig. a), peripancreatic, peribronchial, pulmonary hilar, subclavicular regions, as well as in the pelvis, especially around the iliac arteries, measuring up to 60 mm in diameter; (2) presence of multiple whitish splenic nodules (Fig. b) with the entire spleen shown to be microscopically infiltrated by tumor cells (Fig. a); (3) irregular geographical morphology of the liver (Fig. c) with the lymphoma cells mainly infiltrating the portal areas (Fig. b); (4) involvement of the right lobe of the lung; (5) involvement of both lobes of the prostate consequent to outer connective tissue involvement (Fig. c). Microscopically, the tumor cells in the lymph nodes were shown to have medium-sized irregular nuclei and small nucleoli with a high nuclear cytoplasmic ratio, thus showing diffuse proliferation characterized by the presence of large numbers of small T-cells (Fig. ). Immunohistochemistry revealed the tumor cells to be positive for CD20 (Fig. a), CD79a (Fig. b), bcl-2 (Fig. c), and MUM1 (Fig. d), but negative for CD3 (Fig. e), CD10, bcl-6, and cyclin D1, with a Ki-67 labeling index (Ki-67 LI) of 16% (Fig. f).

The patient states he has had chest discomfort and food intolerance for the past week, but that his symptoms were far worse tonight. He notes no inciting event, recent trauma, or aggravating factors. On exam he appears uncomfortable, anxious, and is in a semi-tripod position. Vitals are pertinent for a heart rate of 144, systolic blood pressure in the 180 s, and oxygen saturation of 89% on 1L O2 via nasal cannula. Of note, the patient weighed 67.2 kg, and was 173 cm tall. Chart review showed that he had lost approximately 4 kg (last recorded weight in chart was 71.2 kg), since his last medical visit.\nPrimary survey was overall unremarkable. Airway was secure, patient\u2019s breathing improved with 3 L oxygen, breath sounds were present and equal bilaterally, vascular access was obtained, and GCS was 15. Intravenous pain medication was given which improved the patient\u2019s blood pressure to systolic 140 s. Given this patient\u2019s overall clinical picture, the most pressing disease processes included myocardial infarction (given history of coronary artery disease and prior infarcts), aortic dissection (given symptoms, hypertension, and medical history), pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism (the previous two diagnoses given his chest pain and decreased O2 even on 1 L of oxygen), and cardiac wall rupture (given multiple prior MIs). Other considerations include congestive heart failure, hypertensive crisis, and an underlying infection.\nLabs were drawn to include a CBC, renal panel, cardiac panel, lactate, and a type and cross. EKG was unremarkable. A chest X-ray was obtained which revealed a widened mediastinum (Fig. ).\nThe patient was stabilized, but the underlying cause of his symptoms had not yet been identified. His widened mediastinum is troubling, and further drives the differential. Aortic (dissection, aneurysm), cardiac (tamponade, wall rupture), and esophageal pathology (rupture versus other masses) now move to the top of the list of diagnoses. Labs continued to be pending. Given his now overall hemodynamically stable status and clinical improvement, the decision was made to obtain a CT chest/abdomen/pelvis which revealed the following (Fig. ).\nAlong with the CT scan; the initial set of labs resulted and were pertinent for leukocytosis (white blood cell count/WBC) of 19,000/mcL, creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, lactate of 3.94 mmol/L, and troponin of 0.101 ng/mL. Although no official read of the images were immediately available, a preliminary read by the team was concerning for mega-esophagus versus a strangulated hiatal hernia. Treatment of the pathology to limit the degree of heart strain (increased troponin), ischemia (as evidenced by the WBC and lactate), and possibility for future perforation were now the primary goals. Night Hawk radiology was contacted for an emergent read, who stated that the images were consistent with a severely dilated esophagus. No pulmonary emboli were visualized, and no other acute abnormalities were reported.\nThe findings, treatment modalities, risks, and benefits were discussed in depth with the patient. Given his dilated esophagus which was severe enough to cause him chest pain, dyspnea, alter his vitals, elevate his WBC, elevate lactate levels, and cause heart strain. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with possible video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), possible thoracotomy, possible laparoscopy, and possible laparotomy were recommended to the patient. The goal was for direct visualization of area, decompression, and repair of any defects. The patient was in full agreement with the plan, and was taken to the operating room shortly thereafter. In the mean time, given the location of the pathology and concern for developing septic picture, the patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and an antifungal.\nOn EGD, the patient\u2019s esophageal distention was found to be from a large bezoar which spanned from the broncho-aortic region of the esophagus to his lower esophageal sphincter. The bezoar was a phytobezoar, with evidence of medication and food particles (meat, vegetables) incorporated into it. The esophageal tissue appeared tenuous and appeared to be the cause of the patient\u2019s lab derangements (Fig. ).\nThe decompression was done carefully and meticulously by fragmenting the bezoar endoscopically using a snare device. About 2 h into the procedure, a repeat set of labs were drawn which showed significant improvement in his labs showing a WBC of now 7600/mcL (from 19,000/mcL), creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL (from 1.4 mg/dL), lactate of 0.86 mmol/L (from 3.94 mmol/L), and a troponin of 0.046 ng/mL (from 0.101 ng/mL). A discussion between the surgical team, anesthesia, and gastroenterology (via telephone) was done in the operating room for planning. Given his hemodynamic stability, improving lab values, and previous CT scan which showed no gross evidence of a leak, the decision was made to end the procedure for further resuscitation with plans to return to the OR for interval endoscopy to re-assess the esophagus. In the meantime, the patient was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics (to include antifungal coverage). He was kept Nil per os (NPO) and was admitted to the intensive care unit.\nThe patient remained hemodynamically normal and clinically stable throughout the night. The multi-disciplinary team determined the best course of action to be complete bezoar debridement, placement of NG tube, nutrition and medical optimization, workup for possible underlying esophageal pathology (to include completion EGD, manometry, and pH probe), and eventual endoscopic versus surgical management of determined condition. The above was again relayed to the patient and his family who fully supported the plan. The bezoar debridement was completed, and the esophagus was inspected for luminal integrity. An NG tube was able to be carefully placed under direct visualization.\nThe patient did well and was eventually able to be downgraded to the regular surgical floor. During his stay, a gastrostomy tube was obtained for feeding access and nutritional optimization. He would undergo several follow-up EGDs during his hospitalization to completely clear the bezoar and assess the esophageal lumen (Figs. and ). After discharge, the patient was further worked up and was found to have achalasia and esophagitis. Thorough workup includes a barium swallow study (patient\u2019s barium swallow shown in Fig. ), EGD, manometry, pH study, and a chest CT (for, among other things, surgical planning).

She had poliomyelitis when she was very young, and there was nothing special regarding her family or psychosocial history. Serology was positive for perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA) and negative for anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA). Her condition was refractory to steroids and complicated by Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Ultimately, she underwent sub-total colectomy and ileostomy in February 2015. Pathological examination of the resection specimen showed diffuse pan-colitis consistent with UC and no indications of Crohn\u2019s disease (Fig. ). She did well in the following 11 months; prednisone was tapered and stopped within 2 months, and she gained 5 kg of weight after the ileostomy. In January 2016, a scheduled restorative ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) with proximal neo-ileostomy was performed.\nFrom one month after the IPAA, her 24-h stool collection slowly increased to 1.5\u20132 L. Next, she noticed decreased urine output since April. In early May 2016, she presented to our emergency room with repeated unconsciousness over the course of 10 days. Her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure (BP), 74/50 mmHg; heart rate (HR), 90 bpm; additionally, she exhibited a poor nutritional status (160 cm; 39 kg). On physical examination, active bowel sounds were noticed to occur approximately 7\u20139 times per minute. Her serum creatinine level was 183 \u03bcmol/L, indicating acute kidney injury. Treatment with fluid replacement and noradrenaline maintained her BP at 80\u201390/50\u201360 mmHg and gradually normalized her creatinine level. However, her 24-h watery stool collection persisted, and she developed fever and vomiting. While many leukocytes were found in stool collected from the diverted ileostomy, repeated stool cultures and tests for Clostridium difficile toxins were negative. Tests for CMV-DNA, CMV-pp65 and EBV-DNA were performed and were all negative. The patient was not on any medications, including NSAIDs, upon verification. Her treatment with steroids was stopped before the end of April 2015. Empirical treatment with antibiotics, including ceftazidime, metronidazole and oral vancomycin, was administered with no response. Due to her reliance on noradrenaline, relative adrenal insufficiency was suspected, and hydrocortisone was initiated at 50 mg q6 h intravenously. Her stool volume decreased to less than 500 ml per day quickly, by which time the treatment with noradrenaline was successfully stopped. The levels of D-lactate, endotoxin and diamine oxidase indicated that the barrier function of the intestine was compromised and that bacterial translocation may have occurred. Oedematous inflamed mucosa with patchy superficial ulcers was observed in the diverted pouch by pouchoscopy. Although an upper endoscopy and an endoscopy through a stoma revealed a normal gross appearance in the stomach, duodenum and pre-stomal ileum (Fig. a, b), the histological examination of tissue biopsies of both the duodenum and pre-stomal ileum revealed enteritis, as indicated by moderate villous atrophy, cryptitis, decreased goblet cells, and severe active inflammation with neutrophil infiltration in the lamina propria, as well as negativity for intraepithelial lymphocytosis (Fig. a-d). From these lines of evidence of histological enteritis presenting in the duodenum, pre-stomal ileum and diverted pouch, we considered pan-enteritis to be present, and we diagnosed the patient with post-colectomy enteritis. The patient was treated with methylprednisolone at 30 mg intravenously once a day with tapering by 5 mg every 7 to 10 days; however, her stool volume from the ileostomy still gradually increased to 3\u20134 L. After a multidisciplinary team discussion, ileostomy closure was debated as the final rescue treatment and was performed in August 2016. Two months later, her stool volume decreased to less than 1 L per day, and she gained 2.5 kg of weight. Azathioprine at 50 mg/d was prescribed during the tapering of prednisone. Until the last follow-up in March 2018, she performed well, with an increase in body weight to 50 kg, and daily defecation approximately 5\u20136 times at less than 1 L/day, sometimes with form (Additional file ). Gastroduodenal endoscopy and pouchoscopy were repeated annually and showed normal villi in the descending duodenum and neo-ileum in March 2018 (Fig. c, d).

We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of creatinine from \u00b5mol to mg. The mass of creatinine is 183.0 \u00b5mol. To convert 183.0 \u00b5mol of creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 183.0 \u00b5mol creatinine * 1e-06 mol/\u00b5mol = 0.000183 mol creatinine. To convert from mol creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.000183 mol creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.021 g creatinine. To convert 0.021 g of creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.021 g creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 21.0 mg creatinine.

Endometrial ablation and dissection of the submucosal myoma were performed within 70 min by monopolar resection. The duration of the procedure was prolonged due to the reduced visibility caused by excessive bleeding and cervical leakage of distension medium, which impeded proper expansion of the uterine cavity. The ventilation pressure increased slowly and continuously 60 min subsequent to the start of surgery. The compliance of the lungs, as well as the achievable minute volume within the acceptable airway pressure limit of 2 kPa, decreased. It was presumed that the level of anaesthesia was insufficient and was followed by the increased administration of propofol (10 mg/kg/h). The additional inhalation of fenoterol did, however, not improve the situation. As ventilation continued to be difficult, the laryngeal mask was replaced by a 7.0 cm (inside diameter) cuffed tube subsequent to the administration of 100 mg succinylcholine as a muscle relaxant. Approximately 50 mL of a foamy, transparent liquid was aspirated from the trachea. Testing with litmus paper indicated an alkaline pH and, therefore, not the aspiration of gastric content. The amount of the pulmonary oedema increased and, despite high levels of peak airway pressures at this point approximately 3 kPa (= set peak pressure limit), adequate ventilation was not possible. Blood gas and electrolyte analyses indicated acidosis, as well as a severe hyponatremia (pH 7.11; Na 74 mEq/L; partial pressure of CO2 49.9 mmHg; saturation of O2 97 % at FiO2 1.0). Cardiopulmonary changes remained minimal. 40 mg of furosemide and 500 mL of 3 % NaCl solution were immediately administered at an infusion rate of 500 mL/h, with constant monitoring for electrolyte changes. As the patient showed clinical signs of impaired haemostasis, the operation procedure was stopped. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit with continuous administration of 3 % NaCl at a rate of 50 mL/h and electrolyte control. Plasma sodium levels increased from 74 mEq/L to 103 mEq/L after one hour, and to 130 mEq/L after 7 h (Fig. ). All together 800 mL of 3 % NaCl solution were administered within 7 h totalling at 24 g. Subsequently, sodium replenishment was stopped and the patient was extubated without problems. Immediate neurological assessment revealed no detectable deficits. 20 h after the onset of hyponatremia, the patient\u2019s sodium levels returned to within the normal range. Until then, the cumulative renal excretion was 8.5 L. 9 L of distension medium was used intraoperatively with a calculated uptake of 5 L.

His medical history was unremarkable, but one year previously his gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels had risen to 271 IU/L (normal: < 30 IU/L). Prior to this, the patient had consumed 540 mL of sake three times a week, and he had been reducing the amount of alcohol he consumed for about one year. He did not smoke or take any recreational drugs. He was single, was not homosexual, and he had not had sexual intercourse for over one year.\nThe patient had undergone treatment of his internal hemorrhoids as an outpatient at a nearby hospital that comprised an aluminum potassium sulfate and tannic acid (ALTA) injection. He developed a fever of 38 \u00b0C, dark colored urine, and itchy skin on postoperative day (POD) 1, and he took loxoprofen sodium, as required. He consulted another doctor on POD 7, because the symptoms had not improved, and his blood test results led to a diagnosis of liver dysfunction. His liver dysfunction had not improved by POD 14, and he was admitted to our hospital on POD 15.\nThe patient was 167 cm tall and weighed 52.5 kg. He presented with a blood pressure of 103/59 mmHg, a heart rate of 82 beats per minute, a temperature of 36.6 \u00b0C, and 99% oxygen saturation in room air. No specific physical findings were evident during the clinical examination on the day of hospitalization, but the patient had a rash, edema, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and jaundice. The subjective symptoms, comprising the fever, dark colored urine, and itchy skin, had disappeared by POD 10.\nThe laboratory test results showed that the patient\u2019s complete blood count was almost normal with a white blood cell count of 6900 cells/\u03bcL, a hemoglobin concentration of 14.7 g/dL, a hematocrit level of 43.1%, and a platelet count of 3.98 \u00d7 105 cells/\u03bcL, but a higher percentage of eosinophils was present (6.8%) (normal: 1.0%-5.0%), which peaked at 13.9% on POD 20. The patient\u2019s serum liver enzyme and bilirubin levels were elevated at the time of admission. The aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level was 432 IU/L (normal: 10-40 IU/L), the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was 911 IU/L (normal: 10-40 IU/L), the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level was 473 IU/L (normal: 115-359 IU/L), and the total bilirubin level was 1.3 mg/dL (normal: 0.2-1.2 mg/dL). Thus, compared with the ALP level, the AST and ALT levels showed greater magnitudes of elevation. The patient\u2019s other blood test results were within the normal ranges, as follows: serum albumin: 4.0 g/dL (normal: 3.8-5.2 g/dL); serum creatinine: 0.86 mg/dL (normal: 0.65-1.09 mg/dL); C-reactive protein: 0.1 mg/dL (normal: 0-0.3 mg/dL); prothrombin time: 100% (normal: 80%-120 %); thyroid-stimulating hormone: 0.5 \u03bcIU/mL (normal: 0.34-4.04 \u03bcIU/mL); triiodothyronine: 2.98 pg/dL (normal: 2.36-5.00 pg/dL); and thyroxin: 1.18 ng/dL (normal: 0.88-1.67 ng/dL). The serological tests for autoantibodies generated weakly positive results (1:40) for anti-nuclear antibodies, and negative results for anti-smooth muscle and anti-mitochondrial antibodies. Negative results were obtained from the tests for the hepatitis B virus surface antigen, the hepatitis C virus antibody, rapid plasma reagin, the anti-Epstein-Barr virus immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody, and the anti-cytomegalovirus IgM antibody, and from the Treponema pallidum hemagglutination test. The IgG level was within the normal range at 1415 mg/dL (normal: 800-1600 mg/dL) and the IgM level was within the normal range at 100 mg/dL (normal: 60-250 mg/dL). The IgE level was elevated at 1333 mg/dL (normal: < 250 mg/dL). Chest radiography did not reveal any abnormalities. No morphological changes were evident following abdominal ultrasonography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, and abdominal computed tomography (Figure ).\nWhen the patient was hospitalized, we considered viral, alcohol-induced, autoimmune, drug-induced, biliary tract, and thyroid function-based diseases as frequent causes of acute liver dysfunction for the differential diagnosis, and, based on the patient\u2019s medical history, and the serological and imaging results, we considered that alcohol and DILI were highly likely causes of the patient\u2019s acute liver dysfunction. However, the patient had stopped drinking during the past year, so we thought that there was a high likelihood of DILI. Therefore, we began conservative treatment with a small amount of extracellular fluid replacement.\nFigure presents the patient\u2019s symptoms, laboratory test results, and treatment over the entire course. The liver transaminase and bilirubin levels decreased rapidly after admission, and the maximum levels were as follows: ALT: 950 IU/L on POD 15; AST: 470 IU/L on POD 17; and total bilirubin: 2.1 mg/dL on POD 17. The ALP and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels showed consistent downward trends from POD 7. The patient's symptoms disappeared on POD 10, and no new symptoms appeared after hospitalization. We performed a liver biopsy on POD 25, and a drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST) of the components of the ALTA injection and lidocaine on POD 28. The patient was discharged on POD 29, and he was managed as an outpatient without any prescriptions. At the time of the patient\u2019s first outpatient appointment on POD 35, his liver transaminase and bilirubin levels had declined and were almost within the normal ranges.\nFigure presents hematoxylin and eosin (H and E)-stained sections of the liver biopsy performed on POD 25. The H and E staining showed that the basic structure of the liver had been maintained without any hepatocyte dropout or disruption, and that the bile duct had not been disrupted. At a higher magnification, the H and E staining showed that the parenchymal cells were partially dilated and that a mild inflammatory cell infiltration was present in the area of the central vein. Neither eosinophil nor plasma cell infiltrations were detected within the liver tissue. Bile plugs were found at multiple sites within the parenchyma and sinusoids. Masson staining did not show the presence of liver tissue fibrosis.\nThe lymphocyte proliferation activity levels, which were determined from the DLST performed on POD 28, were 676 counts per minute (cpm) for the control and 871 cpm for the ALTA with lidocaine. The stimulation index, which was calculated as the ALTA with lidocaine cpm divided by the control cpm, was 1.29 (normal in Japanese people: < 1.8).", "Question": "What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

Two months previously, he developed symptoms of right ptosis and progressive swallowing difficulty. Based on a positive response to edrophonium and increased titers of autoantibodies to acetylcholine receptor (19.3 nmol/L; normal < 0.2 nmol/L), he was diagnosed as having MG with severity belonging to Osserman's classification IIb (ie, generalized moderate weakness and/or bulbar dysfunction). Thoracic computed tomography demonstrated glandular hyperplasia of the thymus (Fig. A). The patient was started on prednisolone 20 mg daily and pyridostigmine 60 mg three times daily. His past history included hypertension without evidence of previous myasthenic crisis or thromboembolic events (eg, history of lower limb swelling). The results of electrocardiography, pulmonary function test [eg, vital capacity: 93%], echocardiography (eg, left ventricular ejection fraction: 85.1%), chest radiography (Fig. B), and laboratory studies (eg, coagulation test) were unremarkable. On the other hand, impaired renal function [i.e., serum creatinine: 1.42 mg/dL; eGFR: 49.1 mL/min/1.73 m2] was observed after admission.\nPreoperative physical examination of the patient showed clear consciousness without respiratory distress. Vital signs included a blood pressure of 187/103 mm Hg, heart rate of 82 beats/min, and respiratory rate of 14 breaths/minute. Under real-time neuromuscular monitoring with a train-of-four (TOF) monitor (TOF-watch SX, N.V. Organon, Oss, Netherlands), anesthesia was induced with propofol (130 mg) and rocuronium (0.85 mg/kg). Following successful tracheal intubation with a double-lumen tracheal tube (Broncho-Cath; Mallinckrodt, Athlone, Ireland), general anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane, rocuronium (total dosage: 40 mg), and a continuous infusion of remifentanil. An 18-gauge peripheral intravenous line and an arterial line were introduced. The surgical time was 4 hours 15 minutes with an estimated blood loss of 100 mL. Upon completion of surgery, sugammadex 4 mg/kg was administered to reverse neuromuscular blockade, with a maximum TOF ratio of 0.93 following reversal. Additionally, intravenous morphine 8 mg was given for postoperative analgesia. After successful extubation in the operating room and resumption of spontaneous breathing, he was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for further care.\nDuring the immediate postoperative period, the patient was hemodynamically stable without respiratory distress. Because of surgical pain with a numeric rating scale of 5 (scale of 0\u201310), intravenous morphine was titrated to a total dosage of 7 mg. Forty-five minutes later, respiratory distress with drowsiness was noted. Physical examination found pinpoint pupils with a TOF ratio of 0.9. Blood gas analysis demonstrated severe hypercapnia (arterial carbon dioxide pressure: 117.7 mm Hg) and acidosis (pH: 6.996, lactate levels: 3.3 mmol/L). On suspicion of morphine overdose, intravenous naloxone was administered twice (0.08 mg each time). After 20 minutes, the patient regained consciousness and normal respiratory pattern. Subsequent blood gas analysis demonstrated hyperlactatemia (lactate levels: 6.0 mmol/L) (Fig. ) despite improvement in arterial carbon dioxide pressure and arterial oxygen pressure after naloxone administration. Taking into account the overall clinical improvement, he was transferred to ward with spontaneous breathing and stable hemodynamics after observation for 100 minutes following initial reversal of opioid overdose.\nHowever, one hour after being transferred to ward (ie, three hours after naloxone administration), he was found to exhibit consciousness loss, respiratory distress, and pinpoint pupils. Intravenous naloxone 0.4 mg was given, followed by endotracheal intubation and transfer to the intensive care unit for mechanical ventilatory support. Brain computed tomography showed no intracranial lesion. He regained consciousness two hours after naloxone administration in the intensive care unit without symptoms of opioid withdrawal (eg, pulmonary edema). As weaning from mechanical ventilation was difficult on POD 3, a diagnosis of POMC was made. Steroid therapy (prednisolone 40 mg twice daily) and pyridostigmine (60 mg 3 times a day) was initiated.

Consciousness at the time of the attack was clear, systolic blood pressure was 120 mmHg, heart rate was 80/min with sinus rhythm, and SpO2 was 89% (O2 10 L). The pain extended to the extremities. The 12-lead ECG at the time of the attack was not significantly different from that at the time of admission (Figure ). Chest radiography showed worsening pulmonary congestion (Figure ). Echocardiography and blood sampling showed no marked change from that on admission, no increase in cardiac enzymes, and no findings strongly suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. When respiratory management by noninvasive positive pressure ventilation was continued, symptoms improved after approximately one hour. Although serum calcium and magnesium levels were not measured at the time of admission, additional examinations revealed hypocalcemia with a calcium level of 4.9 mg/dL and hypomagnesemia with a magnesium level of 1.7 mg/dL. The phosphorus level was 6.3 mg/dL. It was considered that the symptoms were due to a tetanic seizure. The cause of hypocalcemia was thought to be chronic kidney disease (CKD) because parathyroid function, as reflected by intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), was preserved (122.7 pg/mL) despite prior operation on the thyroid gland. Since the level of consciousness and symptoms did not deteriorate, calcium correction was started by oral administration while magnesium was corrected by drip infusion. The patient rapidly responded to intravenous infusion of magnesium and oral administration of calcium and vitamin D preparations. Serum calcium normalized on day 6 of hospitalization and the corrected calcium level was 9.1 mg/dL at the time of discharge. The QTc on ECG decreased from 556 to 491 ms (Figure ). The electrolyte abnormality improved without subsequent recurrence of tetany. The LVEF by echocardiography improved from 15% to 27% at the time of discharge. Although coronary angiography was not performed because of renal dysfunction, the LV contraction failure may have been affected by hypocalcemia. Her heart failure was well controlled with tolvaptan 15 mg, azosemide 90 mg, furosemide 20 mg and and bisoprolol 0.625 mg (Figure ), and she left hospital on the 13th day of hospitalization.", "Question": "What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

In the past 3 years, coil embolization of the hepatic artery and percutaneous drainage of liver cysts had been performed. After the liver cyst drainage, biliary peritonitis occurred and she was treated with antibiotics.\nPreoperative computed tomography revealed remarkable abdominal distension caused by an enlarged polycystic liver (). Results of laboratory tests were as follows: hemoglobin (Hb), 10.1 g/dL; platelet (Plt) count, 27.4 \u00d7 104/\u03bcL; albumin, 2.2 g/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 31.3 mg/dL; creatinine, 0.90 mg/dL; total bilirubin, 0.31 mg/dL; alanine transaminase, 13 U/L; aspartate transaminase, 15 U/L; prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR), 1.18; activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), 30.0 sec; fibrinogen, 573 mg/dL. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm, and transthoracic echocardiography showed normal cardiac function. Portal hypertension was not predicted. The surgeons pointed out a risk of bleeding because of surgical difficulties due to PLD and strong adhesion induced by peritonitis. Blood loss anticipated by the surgeon was 15000 ml. The transfusion unit was preoperatively informed about the possibility of massive transfusion. We ordered 5,600 mL of O type red blood cells (RBC), 4,800 mL of AB type fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 800 mL of AB type platelet concentrate (PC).\nAfter induction of general anesthesia, three 18-gauge peripheral catheters, a 12-gauge triple-lumen central venous catheter, and a pulmonary arterial catheter were placed. Since total clamping of the inferior vena cava requiring veno-veno bypass might be necessary, two 4-Fr introducer sheaths were placed at the femoral vein and the intrajugular vein. Soon after the start of surgery, massive bleeding of more than 4,000 mL/hr occurred (). We started massive transfusion of FFP at a ratio of about 1 : 1 with RBC. We also transfused 5% albumin and restricted the crystalloid solution. Reinfusion of salvaged blood and use of veno-veno bypass with retrieved blood from the operative field were avoided because many cysts of the PLD ruptured during surgery and the blood in the operative field was contaminated by the cystic content. We constantly ordered blood products and communicated with the transfusion unit.\nThe bleeding rate increased as the surgery progressed because bleeding occurred from the area where the tissue was detached from adhesion. Body temperature rapidly decreased despite the use of a rapid infusion and fluid warming system (Level 1 Fast Flow Fluid Warmer, Smiths Medical ASD Inc., Rockland, MA, USA) through 4-Fr introducer sheaths. Although catecholamine administration and massive transfusion from 5 venous lines including the introducer sheath were performed by many anesthesiologists, it was extremely difficult to maintain blood pressure and a critical situation with a risk of cardiac arrest continued due to hypotension. In addition, even though administration of insulin and calcium was performed, electrolyte disturbances of K+ of 6.3 mEq/L and Ca2+ of 2.1 mg/dL (normal range: 4.6\u20135.3 mg/dL) with peaked T wave and prolongation of QTc interval (557 msec) occurred (Figures and ). At that time, we visually noticed that the QT interval was shortened in response to bolus calcium administration, and we therefore displayed the QTc interval on a bedside monitor (CSM-1000 series Life Scope G, Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan) and used the change of real-time QTc interval as a supportive indicator for calcium correction (maximum rate: 120 mEq/hr) combined with blood gas analysis. The hepatectomy was performed without veno-veno bypass 4.5 hours after the start of surgery and the bleeding rate at that time was 15,000 mL/hr (). The excised polycystic liver weighed 10.0 kg.\nUntil portal reperfusion, we continued massive transfusion (approximately 12,000 mL/hr) including 300 mL of PC and sodium bicarbonate with additional fluid warming systems. After portal reperfusion, the bleeding rate gradually decreased and the hemodynamic variables and electrolyte disturbance improved (Figures and ; ). After anastomosis of the hepatic artery, 1 g of tranexamic acid was administered. Except for PC, which was transported from transfusion centers in our region and/or neighboring regions, the supply of blood products was not interrupted and coagulation factors were maintained throughout the surgery by administration of FFP and 3 g of fibrinogen with at least 1.26 of PT-INR, 43.6 sec of APTT, and 116 mg/dL of fibrinogen (). The abdomen was packed with gauzes and closed because complete hemostasis was difficult. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Soon after arrival at the ICU, she responded to command. On postoperative day (POD) 2, second-look surgery was performed for removal of packed gauzes. She was extubated on POD 3 without pulmonary edema or cardiac overload.\nThe duration of surgery was 16 hours and 53 minutes and the duration of general anesthesia was 22 hours and 27 minutes. Throughout the surgery, anesthesia was maintained with 1.5% sevoflurane, 0.16\u20130.33 \u03bcg\u22121 \u30fbkg\u22121 \u30fbmin\u22121 of remifentanil, and intermittent fentanyl administration (total of 1.5 mg).

A total of 742 mEq of calcium ion, 750 mL of 7% sodium bicarbonate, and 18 units of insulin were administered. Postoperative analysis of the relationship between QTc interval and Ca2+ during surgery showed a strong negative correlation (). Representative laboratory data are shown in . Total infusion volume was 88,560 mL (crystalloid solution: 3,450 mL; 6% hydroxyethyl starch: 3,500 mL; 5% albumin: 10,490 mL; RBC: 34,160 mL; FFP: 34,600 mL; PC: 2,400 mL), and total output volume was 86,350 mL (estimated volume of blood loss including ascites and cystic fluid: 81,600 mL; urine output: 4,750 mL); therefore, intraoperative fluid balance was +2,210 mL.

{"Row Number": 11, "Calculator Name": "Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)", "Calculator ID": "2", "Note ID": "pmc-6331344-1", "Patient Note": "A 66-year-old Japanese male was admitted to the authors\u2019 hospital for fever and abdominal pain. He had a past history of multiple renal cysts, chronic renal failure on chronic hemodialysis for 2 years, and multiple liver cysts due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). He showed the relapse of infection of liver cysts and received longtime antibiotics therapies.\nOn admission, his vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 39.4 \u00b0C; heart rate, 101 beats per minutes (bpm); and respiratory rate, 20 bpm. Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7480 cells/mm3 with a high neutrophil count of 90.7%, and a C reactive protein of 18.08 mg/dl. He was diagnosed as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) showed an abnormal high intensity at the multiple liver cysts, indicating that polycystic infection was strongly suspected. Although antibiotic therapy with intravenous meropenem at a dose of 0.5 g/day was started, fever and inflammatory reactions were unable to improve. Therefore, percutaneous echo-guided drainage was introduced for the most accumulated liver cyst. Because of the improvements of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, the drainage tube was removed at 19 days after drainage. However, the low-grade fever and inflammatory reactions recurred, and the discontinuation of antibiotic therapy was difficult. Because the most of the liver showed multilocular cystic changes, the control of infection was considered to be difficult by conservative treatments such as a local drainage or a partial liver resection, and the severe infection was expected to be repeated in the future.\nAs a fundamental treatment, a surgical approach was considered to be necessary, and a liver transplantation surgery was considered to be an indication for the disease. Therefore, he was planned to undergo living-donor liver transplantation with a right lobe graft from his wife. The graft was selected with considering a graft-to-recipient weight ratio of 0.88%, which is larger than the minimal recommended ratio of 0.8%.\nBefore the liver transplantation, he was 168.0 cm tall and weighed 68 kg. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly extending below the level of the umbilicus. Laboratory data showed anemia (Hb 10.4 g/dL), and the elevation of C-reactive protein (2.61 mg/dL). Liver and renal profiles were as follows: total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 17 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 10 U/L; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.3; creatinine, 5.09 mg/dL. His Child-Pugh score was 7 (grade B), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 22. Arterial blood gas analysis showed that blood pH was 7.44, PaCO2 32.9 mmHg, PaO2, 82.1 mmHg in room air, and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient (A-aDO2) was increased to 26.8 mmHg. Chest X-ray revealed an elevation of right diaphragm. Computed tomography (CT) showed hepatomegaly with multiple liver cysts, multiple renal cysts, mild ascites, and no abnormal findings in the lung (Fig. ). Respiratory function test showed the forced vital capacity (FVC) was mildly reduced down to 72% of predicted value, and the adjusted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLco) by Cotes\u2019 method was moderately reduced down to 57.8% of predicted value. Venous ultrasonography revealed lower extremity venous thrombosis, and the day before the operation, an inferior vena cava filter was inserted by a right internal-jugular-vein approach without any complications. At 114 days after admission, a living related liver transplantation was performed. After endotracheal intubation, two central venous catheters were inserted from left and right internal jugular veins before surgery without any complications.\nGeneral anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. The artificial ventilation was uneventful, and the airway pressure was kept below 30 cmH2O during the intraoperative period.\nThe abdominal cavity was reached through the upper abdominal reverse-T incision. The liver was found to swell markedly and to push the right diaphragm upward. Although the liver was firmly adhered to the right diaphragm, the adhesion was sharply dissected by electrocautery under appropriate traction. After the extraction of the liver, the right diaphragm was found to swell markedly and occupy the abdominal cavity. Although there was no significant change in the vital signs, the right pneumothorax was suspected, a thoracic drain was immediately inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and continuous drainage was initiated. However, the right diaphragm distended by a massive air leak and prevented the operators from anastomosing the liver vessels and the bile duct. Therefore, a small relaxing incision was made in the right diaphragm for depressurizing the right thoracic cavity and making an adequate operative field to anastomose. Thoracoscopic observation was performed through the diaphragm incision. There was no adhesion in the right thoracic cavity, and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the right lung was widely expanded like a giant cyst due to dissection from the lung parenchyma, and a marked air leak was recognized from a pin hole in the dissected pleura. Since controlling the air leakage in the patient was considered difficult only by drainage, a leakage closure operation was decided to be performed after the completion of the liver transplantation. Following the transplantation procedure, the thoracoscopic leakage closure operation was performed for the patient in the supine position.\nDuring operation, a thoracoscope was inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and endoscopic surgical instruments were inserted through the small diaphragm incision (Fig. ). The expanded visceral pleura was incised by electrocautery to drain air and pooled blood in the cyst, and bleeding sites in the lung parenchyma were identified and controlled by electric coagulation. Because the lung parenchyma and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the lung was widely dissected and the base of the cyst was large, cystectomy was found to be difficult to be performed by a stapler or sutures. For controlling the air leakage, absorbable fibrin sealant patches (TachoSil\u00ae, Baxtor Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA) were patched on the lung parenchyma under dissected visceral pleura, and fibrin glue (Beriplast P\u00ae, CSL Behring, Tokyo, Japan) was injected into the dissected space. After no air pooling was confirmed under the visceral pleura with positive pressure ventilation, polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets (Neoveil\u00ae, Gunze, Kyoto) were applied, and fibrin glue was sprayed on the visceral pleura surface (Fig. ). Finally, a 21Fr silicone thoracic tube was inserted through the right 10th intercostal space and placed on the apex of right thoracic cavity, and the diaphragm and abdominal incision was closed. Although a postoperative minor air leakage was observed, chest X-ray showed the complete expansion of the right lung. The patient was treated with water seal drainage. After the air leakage disappeared, the drainage tube was removed at 27 days after surgery. The course after liver transplantation was also smooth, and he was discharged at 67 days after surgery. The cyst on the bottom of the right lung was confirmed to disappear on chest CT after discharge (Fig. ).", "Question": "What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

He was diagnosed with hypertension at the age of 40 years, and his blood pressure was poorly controlled with a calcium channel blocker (nifedipine at 40 mg/d). He also had a past medical history of vasospastic angina and was a nonsmoker and social drinker. In addition, he had no family history of cardiovascular diseases. On admission, the patient was 168 cm tall and weighed 59 kg. He was afebrile, with a blood pressure of 161/96 mm Hg and a regular pulse of 61 beats per minute. There was no evidence of lung rales, cardiac murmurs, or an abdominal bruit. His neurological examination was unremarkable. Laboratory tests revealed that his serum creatinine level was 1.1 mg/dL, urea nitrogen level was 19 mg/dL, and serum sodium level was 140 mEq/L. He also exhibited hypokalemia with a serum potassium concentration of 2.9 mEq/L; however, he had no subjective symptoms, including muscle weakness.

Other adrenal hormone levels were within normal limits. A chest radiograph and transthoracic echocardiogram showed no significant findings. An electrocardiogram suggested nonspecific ST-T wave changes with premature atrial contractions.\nPrimary hyperaldosteronism was suspected, and therefore, a captopril challenge test and a saline infusion test were performed. All these investigations revealed positive test results (Table ), which confirmed a diagnosis of PA. A low-dose dexamethasone suppression test to exclude the diagnosis of subclinical Cushing's syndrome was negative. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, which showed a left adrenal mass (13 mm) (Figure ). In adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-stimulated AVS, although aldosterone hypersecretion was observed in the left adrenal gland, the lateralization of the disease was not determined due to incomplete cannulation of the right adrenal vein (Table ). The criteria of successful cannulation were based on the current Expert Consensus Statement.\n131I-adosterol scintigraphy under dexamethasone suppression showed an equivalently increased uptake in both adrenal glands (Figure ). Because we could not exclude the bilateral PA, including aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) with microadenoma in the right adrenal gland, we performed the medical therapy with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA). Although we administrated multiple antihypertensive agents including an MRA (eplerenone at 100 mg/d), an angiotensin II receptor blocker (azilsartan at 40 mg/d), a dual action beta blocker/alpha-1 blocker (carvedilol at 20 mg/d), a calcium channel blocker with an increased dose (nifedipine at 80 mg/d), an alpha-1 blocker (doxazosin at 2 mg/d), and an alpha-2 agonist (guanabenz at 4 mg/d), a home reading of the patient's blood pressure was above 140/90 mm Hg. Moreover, he needed a large quantity of potassium chloride to compensate for his hypokalemia.\nDespite intensive medical therapy, he underwent percutaneous coronary intervention due to stable angina. Following this, we performed AVS again, but the right adrenal vein was not successfully cannulated (Table ). We discussed further the indication for surgery and decided to remove the left adrenal gland.

CT findings revealed thickening of the arterial wall and an aneurysm of the left common iliac artery at the site of the stent (). On the basis of these findings, he was diagnosed with an infected aneurysm due to bare stent infection and underwent surgical treatment.\nThe terminal abdominal aorta and bilateral common iliac arteries were removed because the infection had extended to the aortic bifurcation (). The surrounding infected tissue was debrided, and the terminal aorta was replaced with a rifampicin-soaked bifurcated prosthesis. A pedicled omental flap based on the left gastroepiploic artery was then guided in a retrocolic fashion into the retroperitoneal cavity, to wrap the graft around its entire length.\nThe rifampicin-soaked prosthesis was prepared as follows. First, 300-mg rifampicin capsules (Sandoz Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) were dissolved in a mixture of 6-ml high-pressure sterilized polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate (Tween 80, Wako Seiyaku, Tokyo, Japan) and 54-ml distilled water.

Finally, an 18\u00d710-mm prosthesis (Hemashield Platinum, Maquet, San Jose, CA, USA) was soaked in this rifampicin solution for 15 min.\nHistopathology of the surgically excised artery specimen revealed many inflammatory cells infiltrating the intima, media, and adventitia. Abscesses and masses of Gram-positive cocci were found in all arterial layers, suggestive of an infected aneurysm ().\nStaphylococcus aureus was detected by a bacterial culture of the surgical specimen. Based on the results of his antibiotic susceptibility test, the patient was administered tazobactam/piperacillin 13.5 g/day intravenously for 4 weeks, followed by amoxicillin 750 mg/day orally.

Fourteen days after convulsion, he died of sudden fall in blood pressure (Fig. ).\nAn autopsy was performed, and the brain was pathologically examined. Macroscopically, massive hemorrhage in subarachnoid were seen due to rupture of basilar tip aneurysm (Fig. a, b). Autopsy diagnosis of his death was subarachnoid hemorrhage. Intravascular lumen of the basilar tip aneurysm was nearly obstructed by thrombi (Fig. c). Old cerebral infarctions were seen in the left temporal lobe and other areas. Basilar, left vertebral, bilateral carotid, bilateral middle, and bilateral post cerebral artery showed irregular dilatation of the vessel wall. A microscopic examination of the dilatation area had rupture of the internal elastic lamina and thinning of the media (Fig. d).

Her height was 155.5 cm and body weight was 61.0 kg. Laboratory data showed a creatinine of 1.4 mg/dl, potassium 2.8 mmol/l, calcium 9.5 mg/dl, phosphorus 2.5 mg/dl, uric acid 1.5 mg/dl, normoglycaemic glycosuria and metabolic acidemia (pH 7.30, HCO3\u2212 17.4 mmol/l) (Table ). Bilateral transcervical fractures were confirmed by MRI (Fig. ) and bone scintigraphy showed multiple hot spots in her joints and ribs, compatible with osteomalacia (Fig. ). Hypophosphatemic osteomalacia was diagnosed clinically from a low serum level of phosphorus, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (11.0 pg/dl), high levels of bone specific alkaline phosphatase (67.5 IU/l), and the findings of bone scintigram, although a bone biopsy was not performed. Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) was ruled out by total body survey with whole body computed tomography or endoscopic surveillances and a normal blood FGF23 (22.1 pg/ml, 10\u201350 pg/ml) level.\nUrinalysis showed pH 6.0 and twenty four hour urine demonstrated a low renal fractional tubular reabsorption of phosphate (Tmp/GFR 0.91), increased fractional excretion of uric acid (FEUA 43.9 %) and generalized aminoaciduria.\nThe calculated anion gap was 12.4 meq/l, with an inappropriately alkaline urine (pH 6.0), suggestive of distal type of renal tubular acidosis (RTA). An intravenous bicarbonate loading test to assess the tubular dysfunction demonstrated that the increased fractional excretion of bicarbonate (FEHCO3\u2212 13.25 %) and urine-blood (UB) Pco2 gradient (U-Bpco2 50.1 mmHg), suggesting the presence of proximal type of RTA. NH4Cl loading test was not performed because of the presence of apparent metabolic acidemia. These biochemical data of blood and urine indicated Fanconi syndrome with proximal type of RTA. Tests for anti-SSA and anti-SSB were negative and serum angiotensin converting enzyme levels were normal. Furthermore, serum and urine immunoelectrophoresis revealed no monoclonal component. Any of the patient\u2019s medication did not seem to be related to Fanconi syndrome. Light microscopic examination of a kidney biopsy demonstrated cellular infiltration of interstitium and proximal tubular epithelium composed mainly of CD3+ lymphocytes without glomerular involvement, consistent with features of TIN (Fig. ,).\nThe patient was also suspected to be diagnosed as PBC because of high levels of alkaline phosphatase (663 IU/l), high serum IgM levels (1084 mg/dl) and the presence of anti-mitochondrial M2 antibody (1:10). Sequential liver biopsy demonstrated the presence of a periportal cellular infiltrate (Fig. ), compatible with PBC though biochemical liver function was normal. The combination of these findings led to the patient\u2019s diagnosis of osteomalacia caused by TIN with Fanconi syndrome in asymptomatic PBC.\nThe patient was started on therapy with calcitriol (1 \u03bcg/day), neutral potassium phosphate and sodium bicarbonate (6 g/day). She was subsequently administered middle-dose corticosteroid (20 mg/day of predonisolone) and ursodeoxycholic acid (300 mg/day).

The patient presented with intermittent abdominal distension, which was slightly under no obvious inducement, with no fever, emesis, nausea, or vomiting. Physical examination found no signs of abdominal tenderness and rebound tenderness, and liver and spleen were impalpable.\nLaboratory examination results were as follows: blood routine examination (hemoglobin 132 g/L, red blood cell count 4.61 \u00d7 10 12/L, white blood cell count 10.04 \u00d7 10 9/L, blood platelet count 180 \u00d7 10 12/L), liver enzymes (ALT 10.0 U/L, AST 17.0 U/L, GGT 16.0 U/L, ALP 86.0 U/L, TBIL 12.7 \u03bcmol/L) and renal function (BUN 5.65 mmol/L, SCr 42.0 \u03bcmol/L). Serum tumor markers AFP, CA19-9, CEA, and CA125 were all within normal limits.\nHer past medical history included hemangioma for 20 years, and asthma for 30 years, and she underwent hysteromyomectomy 8 years ago. She did not smoke or drink. The splenic ultrasound revealed multiple hypoechogenic foci measuring 5 to 38 mm in diameter. The contrast-enhanced CT showed multiple space-occupying lesions in the spleen, mottled low-density lesions, multiple hypoattenuating nodules with no contrast enhancement on the arterious phase. Delayed contrast-enhanced helical CT scan displayed incomplete filling of hypodense splenic lesions. Imaging findings raised the suspicion of a vascular neoplasm of the spleen (Fig. A and B).\nGiven that it was uncertain whether it was a benign or a malignant tumor of the spleen, a laparoscopic total splenectomy was performed for the purpose of diagnosis and treatment and informed written consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

The plasty ring was excised and the mitral valve was replaced with a 27-mm bileaflet prosthesis (Edwards Lifesciences). The hemolytic anemia resolved gradually after the reoperation. But the RF persisted after surgery and the patient was transferred to the department of hematology for hemodialysis. Three months later, the LDH level gradually fell to 224 U/L.

The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.\nThe patient is 74 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0.\nThe concentration of Serum Creatinine is 80.4 \u00b5mol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Serum Creatinine from \u00b5mol to mg. The mass of Serum Creatinine is 80.4 \u00b5mol. To convert 80.4 \u00b5mol of Serum Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 80.4 \u00b5mol Serum Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/\u00b5mol = 8.04e-05 mol Serum Creatinine. To convert from mol Serum Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 8.04e-05 mol Serum Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.009 g Serum Creatinine. To convert 0.009 g of Serum Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.009 g Serum Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 9.0 mg Serum Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 9.0 mg Serum Creatinine/10.0 dL = 0.9 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 80.4 \u00b5mol Serum Creatinine/L converts to 0.9 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. Because the patient's gender is male and the creatinine concentration is less than or equal to 0.9 mg/dL, A = 0.7 and B = -0.302.\nPlugging in these values, we get 142 * (0.9/0.7)**-0.302 * 0.9938**74 * 1.0 = 83.072.\nHence, the GFR value is 83.072 ml/min/1.73 m\u00b2.", "Result": "Incorrect"}

Prior to this, the patient had had a 6-month history of lower urinary tract symptoms for which his primary medical doctor had prescribed an \u03b11 receptor antagonist at a dose of 0.4 mg orally once daily. This initially brought about brief mild improvement in the patient\u2019s symptoms, but ultimately there was an increase in lower urinary tract symptoms. The patient denied renal colic, flank pain, or any constitutional symptoms. He had not suffered any recurrent urinary tract infections in the past and denied taking any anticoagulants other than two aspirin occasionally for headache.\nOn presentation to the urology clinic, the patient was found to have severe obstructive urinary symptoms. Rectal examination revealed a grossly abnormal prostate gland with nodularity throughout the entire palpable surface. Laboratory information showed a prostate serum antigen of 20.2 ng/mL. His most recently documented prostate serum antigen was 8.5 ng/mL, which was from one year previously. Baseline blood urea nitrogen/creatinine was 32/0.87. Because the patient had obstructive symptoms and a post void residual of 319 mL, a Foley catheter was placed and he was scheduled for a cystoscopy (as part of the hematuria workup)/voiding trial. He was also put on silodosin 8 mg per day orally and ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days. Upon the patient\u2019s return to the office, his Foley catheter was draining adequately. Post void residual was 600 mL. Cystoscopy showed a large amount of clot in the base of the bladder, which was irrigated to clear, and no active bleeding was noted. Significant distortion and posterior impingement of the trigone was noted, left hemitrigone being greater than the right. No diverticulum or stones were noted. Prostatic urethra showed a near visually obstructing prostate but no intraluminal filling defects of the bladder. A computed tomography (CT) urogram showed left hydronephrosis down to the trigone and some mild nonspecific adenopathy. Urine culture and sensitivity was positive for a Proteus urinary tract infection. The patient was already on ciprofloxacin (which was shown to be sensitive) and responding to treatment. Bicalutamide 50 mg orally once daily and finasteride 5 mg orally once daily were prescribed.\nThe patient underwent transrectal ultrasound and sampling of the prostate gland. It was noted that the patient\u2019s prostatic volume was 14.6 cc. Due to the patient\u2019s age, gross hematuria, and comorbid conditions, a limited six-core prostate biopsy was performed. Biopsy showed six of six cores positive for an adenocarcinoma Gleason grade 9 (5+4) prostate cancer (see ). CT scan and bone scan did not show any evidence of metastatic spread. The patient was diagnosed with clinical stage T2cN0M0 prostate cancer. The patient completed and passed a voiding trial. Bicalutamide, silodosin, and finasteride were continued. A depot suspension of leuprolide acetate (30 mg intramuscularly every four months) was started. Calcium and vitamin D were added for additional support (entirely prophylactic, given that the patient had no vitamin deficits prior to starting leuprolide). At this stage in the patient\u2019s clinical course, his urinalysis was normal and his post void residual was down to 67 mL. The patient was counseled on the management options and chose intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) as treatment for his prostate cancer.\nFiduciary gold seed markers were placed. The patient underwent a planning CT scan which was fused with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The prostate and seminal vesicles were contoured with a planning CT scan, expanded into planning target volumes, and a radiation plan was developed. The patient received 46 treatments over 64 days for a total dose of 8,280 cGy. Phase 1 (planning target volume 1) consisted of the prostate, seminal vesicles, and regional lymph nodes receiving 4,500 cGy in 180 cGy daily fractions. Phase 2 (planning target volume 2) consisted of the prostate alone receiving 3,780 cGy in 180 cGy daily doses. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy using an image-guided linear accelerator (Varian Instruments Inc, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was utilized to minimize both acute side effects and long-term sequelae. The patient tolerated his treatments well. Mild urinary symptoms were experienced, but his urination had been improving and his international prostate symptom score was <15 (9). Therefore, the patient did not require any additional medications and we felt that any surgical intervention (such as transurethral resection of the prostate) for symptomatic relief was not warranted at this time. The patient did develop some bowel symptoms that required a change in diet.\nThe patient was examined by his urologist post radiation therapy and was clinically doing well. He had a post void residual of 104 mL and a significantly reduced prostate serum antigen of 0.4 ng/mL. Repeat renal and bladder ultrasound showed resolution of his previously noted left hydronephrosis. However, just after intensity-modulated radiation therapy ended, the patient began to experience right lower extremity weakness and intermittent numbness from the mid calf distally. The patient had not experienced any falls or trauma. His serum glucose was under control throughout his entire evaluation (prior to treatment it was noted to be 122 mg/dL and then post treatment measured 88 mg/dL). This progressed to require an evaluation by a neurologist. Physical examination showed a mild wide-based stance with decreased stride length and a tendency to circumduct the right lower extremity, with mild to moderate right foot-drop. Initial evaluation included a lumbar puncture, comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood count, urinalysis, positron emission tomography scan, renal ultrasound, and CT scans of the head and spine. All initial studies were negative. Further evaluation included an electromyogram, as well as an MRI scan of the brain/cervical and thoracic spines. MRI of the brain specifically showed only mild diffuse cortical atrophy. The cervical and thoracic spine MRI scans showed a T2 hyperintensity spanning the lateral cortical spinal tracts of the entire cervical and thoracic cords.\nBlood work was collected locally, sent to the Mayo Clinic, and profiled in their paraneoplastic autoantibody evaluation. The profile was consistent with organ-specific neurologic autoimmunity, which suggested an association with multifocal neurologic mainfestations. Specifically, the blood work revealed a positive neuronal voltage-gated potassium channel antibody. These findings combined with MRI of the spine led the neurologist to diagnose the patient with a paraneoplastic syndrome. Magnetic resonance neurography was not done. The patient\u2019s nerve pain was based solely on his personal perspective. The patient was given an ankle-foot orthosis and a cane for ambulation, was started on intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, and referred for home-based physical therapy. At this time, the patient felt that both his strength and ambulation had improved, and his physical therapist agreed.

She had off and on constitutional symptoms of disease such as general malaise, myalgia, polyarthralgia (mainly involved knee, elbow, and ankle joints), anorexia, weight loss, headache, and pyrexia from the last 4 years. She also had a history of recurrent blood-stained nasal discharge, epistaxis, nasal crusting, nasal ulceration, cough, breathlessness, stridor, and wheeze from the last 3 years. She had a history of pedal edema 3 months back. She also complained of diminution of vision with redness of eyes from 3 months. The patient had a history of ulcers on lips and tongue from the past 4 days and decreased frequency of urination from 3 days. There is no history of hematuria, hemoptysis, or cardiovascular manifestations. On examination, her vitals were deranged; she had tachycardia (120/bpm) and hypotension (100/60 mm of Hg). She also had pallor and bilateral pedal edema. There was high suspicion of GPA with acute renal failure or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis associated with systemic small-vessel vasculitis. Keeping these two main diagnoses in mind, the investigations were ordered accordingly.\nIt is based on a combination of clinical manifestations of systemic disease, positive ANCA serology, and histological evidence of necrotizing vasculitis, necrotizing glomerulonephritis, or granulomatous inflammation of affected organs such as skin, lung, or kidney.\nA trucut biopsy was taken from the right kidney of the patient and detailed analysis was done. On light microscopy, there was focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis involving more than 60% glomeruli associated with extracapillary proliferation with pauci-immune crescent formation. Electron microscopic examination showed fibrinoid deposition in the glomerular basement membrane. In biochemistry, serum sodium (159 mmol/L) and serum potassium levels (17 mmol/L) were deranged. In kidney panel, serum urea (155.8 mg/dL) and serum creatinine levels (8.9 mg/dL) were highly increased suggesting severe form of disease.\nOn performing ANCA serology, her serum showed a predominantly diffuse, granular cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) staining pattern on indirect immunofluorescence. By direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, there were high titers of ANCA directed against proteinase-3 (PR-3). PR-3 (1:100 with 1+ intensity) was highly raised and confirmed the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis associated with c-ANCA positivity.\nThe patient underwent two sessions of hemodialysis with a 2-day interval with packed red cell transfusion. Following that, serum urea and creatinine levels were controlled. Due to high levels of circulating c-ANCA autoantibodies, TPE was planned in addition to the standard therapy. GPA comes under category I, Grade 1A; American Society for Apheresis guidelines 2016.[] TPE sessions were started on the 4thday of admission. A total of seven cycles was performed with 1.3 total plasma volumes exchanged on every alternate day. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and normal saline were used as replacement fluids. During the third cycle of TPE after 5 units of FFP transfusion, the patient developed allergic reaction in the form of severe itching all over the body. To treat allergic reaction, oral pheniramine maleate 5 mg and injection hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenous (i.v.) were given, and after 20 min, procedure was restarted and completed successfully. Rest six cycles of TPE was done uneventfully. Simultaneously, standard induction therapy was also started that comprised of combination of cyclophosphamide (500 mg, i.v.) and methylprednisolone 1000 mg, i.v. daily for 3 days followed by oral prednisolone 60 mg daily for at least 4 weeks. Mesna 200 mg slow i.v. over 2 h was also given to prevent cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Regular monitoring of full blood count, serum proteins, renal function, liver function, urine cytology, and clinical symptoms were done. After seven cycles of TPE, the patient was improved clinically as indicated by her renal function tests and ANCA serology and hence TPE was stopped. The patient's recovery was faster due to the timely intervention of TPE along with standard immunosuppression therapy.

The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.\nThe patient is 70 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0.\nThe concentration of Serum Creatinine is 134.0 \u00b5mol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Serum Creatinine from \u00b5mol to mg. The mass of Serum Creatinine is 134.0 \u00b5mol. To convert 134.0 \u00b5mol of Serum Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 134.0 \u00b5mol Serum Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/\u00b5mol = 0.000134 mol Serum Creatinine. To convert from mol Serum Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.000134 mol Serum Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.015 g Serum Creatinine. To convert 0.015 g of Serum Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.015 g Serum Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 15.0 mg Serum Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 15.0 mg Serum Creatinine/10.0 dL = 1.5 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 134.0 \u00b5mol Serum Creatinine/L converts to 1.5 mg Serum Creatinine/dL.

In 2007, he noticed a gradually progressive hearing loss and repeated bloody nasal discharge resulting from a refractory sinusitis. He was admitted to our hospital for evaluation in June 2008.\nInitial laboratory findings revealed elevated serine proteinase 3-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (PR3-ANCA; 26.2 EU), blood urea nitrogen (35 mg/dl), and serum creatinine (1.62 mg/dl) levels. Urinalysis indicated proteinuria (0.2 g/day) without hematuria. A head CT revealed maxillary sinusitis. Tissue from a nasal mucosal biopsy showed granulomatous inflammation in the extravascular area. Because of these combined findings, he was diagnosed as having granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) according to the American College of Rheumatology 1990 Criteria for GPA and Watts\u2019 algorithm [, ]. The Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score 2003 was 6. Because of the low disease activity, the slow progression and the advanced age, we did not initiate immunosuppressive therapy at this time.\nIn October 2008, he developed fever lasting for several days. Laboratory data were as follows: C-reactive protein 11.91 mg/dl, PR3-ANCA 49.1 U/ml, fibrinogen 752 mg/dl, D-dimer 1.7 \u00b5g/ml, and urinary protein 0.27 g/day. Activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time and fibrin degradation product were within the respective normal range. A chest CT was normal. Although we administered meropenem (2.0 g/day for 1 week), vancomycin (500 mg/day for 17 days) and itraconazole (200 mg/day for 20 days), the fever and C-reactive protein level did not decrease. On day 12 of admission, he showed mild disorientation, severe hearing loss and hoarseness. A brain MRI revealed a mass lesion in the right frontal lobe and hypertrophic mucosa in the paranasal sinuses (fig. ) in addition to a thickened and strongly enhanced dura mater surrounding the mass lesion (fig. ). He was diagnosed as having GPA with central nervous system (CNS) involvement. The Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score had increased to 21. We treated him with methylprednisolone 500 mg daily for 3 days. However, he rapidly developed left hemiparesis and deterioration of consciousness [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS): E1V2M4]. A brain CT revealed that the parenchymal mass lesion had enlarged and the mucous effusion was invading the posterior wall of the right frontal sinus. Due to an impending transtentorial herniation, a decompressive hemicraniectomy and partial right frontal lobectomy were performed, which moderately improved his consciousness (GCS: E2V3M4). After the surgery, he developed bloody sputa, and a chest CT revealed an infiltrative shadow in both lungs. We confirmed alveolar hemorrhage by bronchoscopy.\nThe biopsied brain material from the surgery revealed a granulomatous inflammation with geographic necrosis and multinucleated giant cells in the perivascular area of the thickened dura mater and leptomeninges (fig. ). Small vessels in the meninges were involved in the granulomatous lesions, and the lumens of the veins were often occluded. In the cerebral cortices and the white matter in these areas, hemorrhagic infarction was widely observed.

Podocyturia was performed as described previously []. Briefly, the podocyte count was assessed by counting in urinary smears the number of cells in 10 microscopy fields of \u00d720. The podocyte count was 2.1 cells per \u00d720 field and the number of podocytes per gram of urinary creatinine was 166 (). Podocytes were identified by tagging synaptopodin (ab109560 Alexa Fluor\u00ae, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), an specific marker of podocytes, to establish their identity by immunofluorescence techniques using a secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488, Abcam, Cambridge, Uk).

Her history was notable for a background history of congenital biliary atresia (BA). She had undergone an early Kasai portoenterostomy with Roux-en-Y anastomosis in the early neonatal period. Her subsequent postoperative course was complicated by two episodes of cholangitis. By the age of two she had developed portal hypertension resulting in secondary thrombocytopenia due to hypersplenism. She had developed esophageal varices requiring annual sclerotherapy until the age of sixteen when she underwent variceal banding. Her vaccinations were up-to-date.\nGeneral findings on presentation at 11 weeks revealed icterus with scattered spider naevi. On abdominal inspection there was an upper abdominal scar from her prior surgery and on palpation the spleen was enlarged extending to below the level of the umbilicus; there was no evidence of ascites.\nAn ultrasound confirmed her estimated date of delivery. She was referred to the medical clinic at the hospital to provide a multidisciplinary team input to her care.\nAt sixteen weeks she developed an episode of cholangitis and she was treated with intravenous antibiotics for seven days. A liver ultrasound was performed. This revealed absence of intrahepatic dilatation with multiple periportal and peripancreatic varices and 14 cm splenomegaly. During the pregnancy her platelets remained low (29\u201355 \u00d7 109 L) and hemoglobin ranged from 8.8 to 10.5 g/dL. Her transaminases were marginally elevated (AST/ALT, 46/67) and coagulation parameters were normal. Significant concern remained about her thrombocytopenia and degree of hypersplenism.\nA multidisciplinary meeting was convened with hepatology, hepatobiliary surgery, and interventional radiology. Concerns for this patient included her significant splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia, risk of recurrent cholangitis, potential for massive variceal hemorrhage, and potential for preterm delivery, either spontaneous or iatrogenic. Abdominal delivery would also be compromised by large venous anastomoses in the anterior abdominal wall. A plan for management of gastrointestinal hemorrhage was outlined. Further imaging of her portal vessels was recommended as this would inform the interventional radiologists as to which was the optimum surgical intervention should bleeding develop from intraabdominal varices. The option of a splenectomy in pregnancy was excluded as this was deemed likely to cause portal vein thrombosis and would compromise any future candidacy for liver transplantation. At twenty weeks she underwent MR venography of the portal vessels. Her spleen measured 23 cm, there was evidence of extensive splenic and esophageal varices, and no lienorenal shunt was identified.\nShe had bimonthly antenatal visits with her obstetrical and hepatology teams. Her anatomy scan was within normal limits with a well-grown fetus on the 31st centile. Due to the complexity of the case and the potential for preterm delivery she received two doses of betamethasone at twenty-six weeks of gestation to aid lung maturation.\nAt 26+3 she presented to the maternity hospital with vaginal bleeding, suprapubic pressure, and uterine contractions for 24 hours with increasing intensity and duration. The fundal height was consistent with 26 weeks of pregnancy and cardiotocography was reassuring. Sterile speculum examination confirmed that the cervix was 5 cm dilated and fully effaced and the amniotic membranes were bulging through the cervix. A bedside ultrasound scan confirmed a breech presentation. Her platelet count was 33 \u00d7 109/L. Following consultation with perioperative medicine, the hepatobiliary team, and neonatology the decision was made to perform an emergency caesarean section. It had been planned to perform her surgery in a general hospital; however, due to the acute nature of her presentation the caesarean section was undertaken in the obstetric facility, with hepatobiliary surgery and interventional radiology on standby in the general hospital. Pooled platelets were administered immediately prior to surgery. Magnesium sulphate was administered to provide fetal neuroprotection. The caesarean section was performed via a vertical subumbilical incision, with a lower segment transverse incision on the uterus. The vertical incision was utilized both to provide greater access to the abdominal cavity should bleeding occur, either from the uterus or the varices, and to avoid large venous collaterals running vertically in the abdominal wall. A live male baby was delivered by breech extraction and transferred to the pediatric team following delayed cord clamping of 45 seconds. Apgar's scores were 61, 65, and 710; the cord blood gases were pH 7.27 (arterial) 7.29 (venous). The infant weighed 890 grams. The remainder of the surgery was uneventful. Perioperatively she received a further pooled platelet transfusion with good hemostasis and no transfusion of packed red cells was required. Her baby was transferred to intensive care and initially required CPAP. He had an uncomplicated neonatal course. Histology of the placenta was unremarkable. The patient had an uneventful postpartum course. She was advised against further pregnancies in view of her significant risks and underwent insertion of a levonorgestrel coil at three months postpartum for contraceptive purposes and she is currently awaiting liver transplantation.

The patient received cardiopulmonary resuscitation including chest compressions, endotracheal intubation, and the administration of 3 mg Adrenaline. Return of spontaneous circulation occurred approximately 10 min later at which point he was transferred to a local hospital. During the transport, the cardiocirculatory parameters were relatively stable with a systolic pressure around 100 mmHg. The capnometry after return of spontaneous circulation measured a pCO2 of 60 mmHg. Upon arrival at the hospital, the physical examination showed jugular vein distension but no peripheral oedema.\nEchocardiography performed in the emergency department revealed a pericardial tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis via the subxiphoidal route, 800 mL of blood were initially evacuated. The differential diagnosis included primary respiratory failure or a sudden cardiac death with secondary pericardial effusion induced by cardiac compressions under double antiplatelet therapy, a ruptured aortic aneurysm, a myocardial rupture, or a primary laceration of a cardiac structure by the LAA occluder. A ruptured aneurysm of the ascending aorta was excluded by ultrasound. Electrocardiogram examination did not demonstrate any ST-segment elevation or low voltage. Blood gas analysis documented a stable respiratory situation with a pO2 of 230 mmHg and a pCO2 of 55 mmHg, the pH was 7, 3 and Lactate elevated with 10 mmol/L (<2 mmol/L). The haemoglobin was measured at 9 g/dL (12\u201316 g/dL). The chest X-ray demonstrated the proper placement of the endotracheal and pericardial tube and ruled out a pneumothorax or pulmonary oedema.\nIn the hours following pericardiocentesis, approximately 2 L of blood were evacuated. Conventional methods of coagulopathy management including application of tranexamic acid, fresh frozen plasma, and fibrinogen did not stop the bleeding. To stabilize the patient a total of eight packs of red blood cells were transfused.\nIn preparation of cardiac surgery, a coronary angiogram was performed (). It revealed active leakage of contrast agent in the proximal circumflex artery and the patient was transferred to the cardiac surgery department immediately. Intra-operatively a perforation of the tissue at the basis of the LAA close to the left main coronary artery was discovered. Under protection of cold blood cardioplegia on cardiopulmonary bypass the occluder was excised through the opened left atrium. The LAA was closed by endocardial sutures and two pledget sutures were used to seal the epicardial lesion at the LAA basis which stopped the bleeding.

He had truncal obesity, a \"moon face\" and proximal muscle weakness. An electrocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy. His laboratory work-up revealed anaemia (Hb 10.7 g/dl), hypokaliemia (3.4 mEq/L), metabolic alkalosis (HCO3- 35 mmol/L) and hyperglycaemia (170 mg/dl). A CT scan of thorax and abdomen demonstrated a dissection starting just below left succlavian artery and extending downward to the left renal artery, involving the celiac tripod and superior mesenteric artery (). The dissection was classified as Stanford B, De Bakey III. Moreover CT scan of abdomen revealed incidentally a left adrenal tumour of 25 mm of diameter.\nThe patient was pharmacologically treated and was felt at risk for impending aortic rupture. Therefore, an emergent endograft positioning was planned. Our goal was to exclude the damaged segment of the aorta and to obliterate the entry of blood into the false lumen (both at the initial intimal tear and at the secondary tears along the vessel). Through an inguinal incision, the right common, superficial and profunda femoral artery were dissected free. A prosthetic graft (Valiant, Medtronic, Sunnyvale, CA, USA 42 mm x 198 mm) was placed just below the origin of the left succlavian artery up to the diaphragmatic hiatus. A postoperative control CT scan demonstrated the correct graft positioning, not endoleaks and the closure of all secondary tears ().\nThis patient was evaluated for hypercortisolism and the plasma cortisol was increased to 33.9 \u03bcg/dl (vn, value of normal, 5.6-23 \u03bcg/dl) without circadian rhythm and not suppressed by the administration of 1 mg of dexamethasone (overnight text: 9.8 \u03bcg/dl; vn <1.8 \u03bcg/dl ). The plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was less than 10 pg/ml (vn 12-60 pg/ml) and 24h urinary free cortisol excretion (UFC) was elevated 465.6 \u03bcg/24 h (vn 26-135 \u03bcg/24h ).\nA MRI of abdomen was performed to have a more accurate evaluation of the adrenal mass, it was of 2 cm of diameter, well capsulated, hyperintense in T1 sequences with a normal reduction of signal in T2 weighted sequences ().\nA diagnosis of CS was made on basis of the endocrinological tests and for the presence of left adrenocortical lesion.

The patient had a medical history of well-controlled diabetes mellitus and hypertension that was being treated with an angiotensin receptor blocker, a calcium channel blocker, and a beta blocker. The body mass index was 33.8, but he had no respiratory symptoms, including sleep apnea. A preoperative chest X-ray showed mild cardiomegaly but electrocardiography and echocardiogram findings were normal. The patient's symptoms were amnesia, gait disturbance, and urinary incontinence that had persisted for 5 months; preoperatively, he was alert and cooperative and had no problem communicating. The preoperative vital signs were: blood pressure, 110/70 mmHg; heart rate, 59 beats/min; respiratory rate, 18 breaths/min; and oxygen saturation, 96%. Since the appearance of the patient suggested a possible difficult intubation, a video laryngoscope was used for tracheal intubation after induction of general anesthesia with 150 mg propofol 1%, 40 mg lidocaine 2%, and 60 mg rocuronium. The vocal cord was clearly visible on the video laryngoscope and the intubation was accomplished without trauma or other difficulties. Anesthesia was maintained with 5% desflurane and 0.02 \u00b5g/kg/min remifentanil, and air with 50% oxygen. The surgery lasted 2 hours and required no additional muscle relaxants. During the surgery, there was sudden and sustained hypotension (mean blood pressure 52\u201357 mmHg) with bradycardia (heart rate 45\u201355 beats/min) that did not respond well to ephedrine; these complications began about 10 min after the beginning of the surgery and lasted for 25 min until a dopamine infusion was administered that restored normal blood pressure. Remifentanil infusion was discontinued at the onset of hypotension and bradycardia. After the purge of volatile agents at the end of the surgery, the train of four (TOF) count was 4, and the ratio was 50%, so 2 mg/kg of sugammadex was injected. The patient recovered muscle power within a few minutes, showing firm hand grip, head elevation, and mouth opening, and was fully obeying verbal commands, but was not opening his eyes. As he was alert and cooperative at that point and no other neurologic deficit was observed, the neurosurgeons thought that the inability to open his eyes was not related to the surgery. We relieved the bandage on the head in order to reduce the chance of unintended pressure or tension on the forehead, and suggested that further neurologic examinations be done after full recovery from anesthesia. Spontaneous respiration was present, showing expired tidal volumes reaching 500 ml each time, but was tachypneic; the patient's respiratory rate ranged from 40 to 50 breaths/min. This condition continued for 5 min, at which time the patient was extubated and transferred to the PACU under mask ventilation. The patient showed signs of inspiratory stridor, chest retractions, and hoarse voice after the extubation. The patient's accessory respiratory muscles were not involved in the hyperventilation. There was no crackle or wheezing clear on auscultation besides the inspiratory stridor, but the findings were not clear on account of the hoarse voice and the rapid and dynamic ventilation. An additional 2 mg/kg of sugammadex was injected in the PACU under the theory that the patient's upper airway was obstructed because of possible residual paralysis but the condition did not change. The patient was fully responsive to verbal commands but was still unable to open his eyes or hold his breath and he complained of feeling like he was choking despite the hyperventilation. Arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) at that point showed: pH, 7.35; pCO2, 37 mmHg; pO2, 76 mmHg; HCO3, 20.4 mmol/L; and O2 saturation, 94%. The vital signs at that point were: blood pressure, 150/90 mmHg; heart rate, 110 beats/min; and respiratory rate, 44 breaths/min. Since tachypnea (40\u201350 breaths/min) persisted for 20 min in the PACU and oxygen saturation started to drop under 95%, 200 mg thiopental sodium and 100 mg succinylcholine were injected and endotracheal intubation was performed. Endotracheal suction was done immediately after intubation and there was no sputum or discharge. Auscultation right after the re-intubation sounded smooth, without crackle or wheezing, and the oxygen saturation rapidly corrected to 100%. Tachypnea persisted even under sedation after the succinylcholine wore off, so a central cause was suspected. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a massive pneumocephalus with pneumoventricle and hydrocephalus (). A chest X-ray taken after the brain CT showed no pathologic findings such as pulmonary edema, congestion, or pneumothorax. On the neurosurgeon's recommendation, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and was kept there for three days under mechanical ventilation with sedation with midazolam, cisatracurium, and rocuronium until the pneumocephalus and tachypnea spontaneously resolved. Follow-up chest radiographs were taken over the next 3 weeks and showed nothing abnormal. According to a pulmonology consultation, the tachypnea was not likely to have originated from pulmonary problems. ABGA results stayed within normal limits under fully controlled mechanical ventilation but showed hypoxemia when the patient gained spontaneous respiration during the sedative period before the resolution of the pneumocephalus. Since the follow-up chest X-rays showed no abnormal findings, pulmonary embolism evaluation including embolism CT and laboratory examinations, which also showed nothing abnormal, were done on the recommendation of a pulmonologist. When a follow-up brain CT showed resolution of the pneumocephalus on the 3rd day after the surgery, sedative and neuromuscular blocking agents were discontinued and the mechanical ventilation mode was switched to synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation. The respiratory rate at that point ranged from 15 to 20 breaths/min and ABGA results remained normal when the patient gained consciousness and self-respiration, so the endotracheal tube was extubated. The patient is now (30 days post-operation) in the general ward; he is mentally alert and has stable vital signs but still is unable to open his eyes because of bilateral ptosis and is receiving conservative treatment.", "Question": "What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?", "LLM Answer": "2", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "2", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The current CHA2DS2-VASc score is 0.\nThe patient is 59.0 years old.

He had a prior history of cerebral infarctions (x3) at the age of 66, 74 and 75 years, with a first instance of swallowing difficulties after the third stroke. At that time, dysphasia rehabilitation was initiated within 3 days of the stroke, and he recovered the ability to eat a regular meal within 2 weeks. In January 2018, 1-year after his last stroke, he underwent surgery for spinal stenosis, followed by a 10-day period of bedrest. His physical activity level subsequently declined due to back pain, and he lost 10 kg within the 10 months after surgery. Swallowing difficulties re-emerged in September 2018, with the patient only able to tolerate soft meals. His dysphasia worsened, with an increase in sputum and development of a chronic cough.\nHis medical history included cerebral infarctions (x3), diabetes mellitus, spinal stenosis, and hypertension. His height was 168.8 cm, with a body weight of 56.5 kg. He had a right hemiplegia, with the following functional measures: grip strength, 25 kg; gait speed, 0.7 m/s, assessed using the 5-m walk test; and skeletal mass index, 6.6 kg/m2. His score of 5 points on the Mini Nutritional Assessment Short Form was indicative of malnourishment. Absence of another cerebral infarct was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. Video-endoscopic swallowing assessment showed saliva pooling in the pharynx, widening of the pharyngeal space, vallecular and pyriform sinus residue, and aspiration (A). Video-fluorography revealed a decrease in the forward movement of the larynx, a widened pharyngeal space, weakened pharyngeal constriction, vallecular and pyriform sinus residue, and aspiration (A\u2013C). Functional swallowing scores were as follows: Hyodo score, 9; Fujishima grade, 6; FILS, 8; and dysphasia severity scale, 4. A probable diagnosis of sarcopenic dysphagia was made, based on the criteria defined by Mori et al. [] Clinical management included swallowing training, a high-protein diet, and nutritional guidance. The patient declined additional rehabilitation, due to his previous experience post-stroke. Therefore, we presented laryngeal suspension as a possible alternative treatment, which was performed in December 2018.\nLaryngeal suspension was performed via a minimally invasive thyromadibulopexy, using two skin incisions: one (2-cm) incision at the level of the mandible and the other (3-cm) between the hyoid bone and the superior border of the thyroid cartilage (A). Identified the white line, divided aside the anterior cervical muscles, and exposed the thyroid cartilage. Also the mandible was exposed. Two holes in the mandibular and six holes in the thyroid cartilage was made by using drill. The thyroid cartilage was fixed to the mandible using No. 2 nylon. No. 2 nylon thread was passed through the Gore-tex sheet cut to the size of thyroid cartilage. And it was passed through the thyroid cartilage, subcutaneous tunnel on the hyoid bone, mandible, subcutaneous tunnel on the hyoid bone, and tied to the other side of the nylon. As the two holes of the middle of the thyroid cartilage, two No. 2 nylons was crossed to fix the thyroid cartilage and mandible. The larynx was suspended about one vertebral body by totally using five No. 2 nylons (B), confirmed by X-ray fluoroscopy. A 1-cm incision was performed for tracheotomy, and cuffed tracheal cannula was inserted for airway management.\nMaintaining some neck flexion for a period of 1-week was conducted. Nutritional support was initiated via gastrostomy tube feeding. The cuffed tracheal cannula was changed to an uncuffed cannula on postoperative day (POD) 1. The wound was stable and there was no pain. Swallowing was initiated using jelly and cold tea, with the patient in a flat lateral position. The tracheal cannula was removed on POD 4. Video-fluorography revealed contrast agent residue in the vallecular but with a decrease in residue in the pyriform sinus compared to pre-operative measures, with no evidence of aspiration on POD 6 (A\u2013C). Anterosuperior movement of the larynx was improved, reaching one vertebral level higher than before surgery. The swallowing reflex was maintained, with sufficient opening of the esophageal orifice, avoiding the need for mandibular protrusion to swallow. Swallowing using modified food was initiated in a sitting position on POD 6 and the gastrostomy tube was removed on POD 7. Video-endoscopic examination confirmed his ability to eat a rice cracker and noodles without aspiration and no evidence of pharyngeal residue on POD 11 (B). The patient was able to eat soft meals on POD 14, and a regular meal on POD 18, and was discharged on POD 21. The patient gained 2 kg in the 2 months after surgery, with improvement in functional scores: Hyodo score, 5; Fujishima grade, 8; FILS, 8; and dysphasia severity scale, 6.

Main results of laboratory tests on admission included the following: white blood cells 4400/\u03bcL, hemoglobin 13.3 g/dL, platelets 305 000/\u03bcL, Na 135 mmol/L, K 3.6 mmol/L, Cl 102 mmol/L, Ca 6.4 mg/dL, Pi 4.6 mg/dL, albumin 1.8 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen 49.9 mg/dL, creatinine 5.3 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein 26.1 mg/dL. The electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with long PR and QT intervals. Deterioration of renal functions for the last 10-year period is illustrated in Figure . For the last 3 months, hemodialysis was needed.\nPlain and contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans, performed on the first and eighth days of hospitalization, respectively, indicated significant ischemic changes of the sigmoid colon through the rectum with wall thickening of the sigmoid colon, ascites retention, bilateral pleural effusions, and mild renal atrophy. Colonofiberscopy indicated diverticulosis in the sigmoid colon and ischemic changes and erosions of the stenotic sigmoid colon through rectum (Figure ). Microbiologically, the stool proved normal flora, and fecal Clostridium difficile toxin test and blood microbial culture were negative. The clinical diagnosis of ischemic and infectious colitis secondary to the long-term usage of antibiotics was made. Intravenous infusion of ceftriaxone for 5 days was chosen empirically because it is metabolized in the liver. However, it was ineffective for relieving diarrhea and colitis, and then meropenem was chosen for controlling the intractable colonic symptoms. Inflammation peaked out 14 days after the treatment, but soon, the inflammatory reaction and diarrhea re-exacerbated. The patient expired 26 days after admission. No free air was observed in the abdominal cavity on the contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan 3 days before death.\nThe autopsy was conducted 6 hours after death. In the sigmoid colon, fibrosing and adhesive diverticulitis with mucosal ischemic changes and erosions were grossly observed. Microscopically, eosinophilic hyaline material was deposited throughout the gut wall. The deposits were congophilic. Immunohistochemically, amyloid A, visualized by the monoclonal antibody mc-1 against serum amyloid A1 (SAA1), was identified in the lamina propria mucosae through the subserosa, including diverticular and vascular walls (Figure ). In the prepylorus of the stomach, a large perforating ulcer measuring 12 mm was found, and purulent peritonitis with turbid ascites was associated (Figure ). Candida infection was microscopically demonstrated on the involved mucosa and serosa at the site of gastric perforation (Figure ). Candida albicans were cultured from turbid ascitic fluid containing a total of 1150 mL. Candidal esophagitis was also noted. Deposition of amyloid A was evident in the gastric mucosa through the subserosa, and the amyloid deposition was especially prominent and seen in the full-thickness of the mucosa at the site of gastric perforation (Figure ). Amyloid A was also diffusely deposited in the wall of the esophagus through the rectum. Pleural effusion was associated (left: 150 mL, right: 300 mL).\nSystemic congophilic deposition of amyloid A was further demonstrated in the tongue, salivary gland, thyroid gland, lung, heart, pancreas, splenic white pulp, adrenal glands, kidney, urinary bladder, and ureter. The deposition was especially pronounced in the thyroid gland (38 g) and urinary tract.\nAtrophic kidneys weighed 72 g (left) and 73 g (right). Microscopically, amyloid A deposits caused amyloid glomerulopathy in association with vascular wall involvement. Features of diabetic glomerulosclerosis were indistinct because of marked amyloid deposition, while arteriolosclerosis was observed. Pancreatic islets focally showed diabetes-related localized hyaline (amyloid) deposition. Characteristically, co-deposition of amyloid A and IgM in the renal glomerulus was demonstrated by immunostaining using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections after prolonged protease-1 digestion (Figure ). IgG and IgA were undetectable. The co-deposition of amyloid A and IgM was scarcely observed in the systemic amyloid A deposits outside the kidney (Figure ).\nMost of the hepatocytes were immunostained with the anti-SAA1 monoclonal antibody mc-1. Cytoplasmic granular positivity was evident. The acinar cells of the pancreas and salivary gland were also positively stained. These findings indicated accelerated production of SAA1 protein by these cells as a prolonged inflammatory response (Figure ).\nAnother incidental finding included aortic stenosis caused by dystrophic calcification in the cusps of the aortic valve. Left ventricular hypertrophy (heart weight 415 g) was caused by both aortic stenosis and amyloid deposition. The aorta revealed severe atherosclerosis. The abscess lesion around the right femoral prosthesis was not evaluated.", "Question": "What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg?", "LLM Answer": "87", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "106.0", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The mean average pressure is computed by the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure).

Her medical history was remarkable for heterozygote alpha-thalassemia, but negative for thrombotic and recurrent infectious events. The family history was also negative for thrombotic events or bleeding tendency. The patient was not treated with anticoagulants or platelet inhibitors. Physical examination was normal (BMI 23.0 kg/m2, blood pressure 125/70 mmHg, heart rate 85/min, normal heart sounds, and no vascular murmurs). After the exclusion of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, vasculitis, hyperviscosity, and sickle cell disease, a thrombophilia workup was performed. All hemostatic laboratory parameters were found normal except for an increased protein S activity (179%) with high free protein S level (207%), despite a normal total protein S antigen level (98%) (Table ). This suggested that, in contrast to normal conditions, all protein S was free protein S, instead of 30\u201340% free and 60\u201370% bound protein S. High activity and antigen levels of free protein S were confirmed in a separate sample 3 months later. Clinically, a protein S deficiency is considered as a possible cause of hypercoagulation, which in turn could have led to the retinopathy. The incidental finding of elevated protein S levels were not considered explanatory of the condition. We did not initiate anticoagulation or thrombocyte aggregation inhibition. The patient's vision did not improve remarkably, nor did it deteriorate in the subsequent months after her initial visit.\nThe high free protein S level in the proband was caused by a reduced level of C4BP (18%), as measured with an ELISA against the \u03b1-chain of C4BP. To identify a possible molecular defect underlying the C4BP deficiency, we sequenced the protein-coding regions and exon/intron boundaries of C4BPA (encoding C4BP\u03b1, ) and C4BPB (encoding C4BP\u03b2, ).\nWe identified two previously reported non-synonymous variants in C4BPA, that is, c.719G>A (p.R240H), rs45574833 ((A=0.0140/1686 (ExAC), A = 0.0030/15 (1000 Genomes), A = 0.0095/124 (GO-ESP), A = 0.0078/227 (TOPMED)), and c.899T>C (p.I300T), rs4844573 (C = 0.4014/47780 [ExAC], C = 0.4898/2453 [1000 Genomes], C = 0.4841/6296 [GO-ESP], T = 0.4689/13653 [TOPMED]).\nIn addition, we screened the father and brother for these mutations. Both are also Surinamese. Only p.I300T was present in the father (Fig. ). Both father and brother had normal free protein S levels. Mother, second sister, and second brother were unavailable for testing.\nDiscordant data concerning the association between C4BP polymorphisms and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome have been reported , . Furthermore, these two variants have also been identified in women experiencing recurrent miscarriages, but due to equally high frequencies between patients and controls, the importance of these variants in this particular clinical situation may be questionable . No mutations were found in the C4BPB gene.\nBecause we could not find clear molecular defect in the C4BP gene responsible for the reduced expression, and a recent report indicated that binding of protein S to C4BP promotes cellular secretion of C4BP , we also sequenced the sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)-like region of protein S (), responsible for binding to C4BP using the previously published primers , . No mutations explaining a reduced binding of protein S to C4BP were found in the SHBG-domain of protein S.\nAlthough the medical records did not report any use of vitamin K antagonist, we excluded the interference of any form of vitamin K antagonists by the measurement of coagulation factors II, VII, and X which were all normal, except for factor X which was slightly increased (163%) (Table ). Furthermore, there was no indication of reduced capacity of liver synthesis with normal antithrombin and factor V levels.

Her blood glucose level was 120 mg per deciliter. Oxygen saturation was 100 percent on 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula.\nPhysical evaluation showed no signs of head trauma. Her respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. Neurological examination showed decreased sensation to light touch in a stocking and glove distribution. Upper limb reflexes were brisk and lower limb reflexes were absent. Vibratory sensation and position sense were decreased in both upper and lower limbs. An extensor plantar response was noted bilaterally and Romberg's test was positive. There was hyperpigmentation of both palms with dark discoloration of the nails (). Axillary and pubic hair was normal in distribution and density.

Electrocardiogram confirmed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Echocardiogram revealed a myopathic severely enlarged left ventricular chamber with moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and severe global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 8 to 10%. The patient's work of breathing and oxygenation improved with Bipap. He was started on diltiazem and diuresis was initiated. The patient was admitted to the step-down unit with a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation.\nOn hospital day number eight, the overnight nurse found the patient unresponsive. A code blue was called. His initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation and he was shocked with 200 J twice before regaining pulses. When stabilised, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) where he regained consciousness and full neurologic function within one hour of the event. The following day, an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) was placed. Intraoperatively, the patient had runs of ventricular tachycardia with hypotension to 80 mmHg systolic. Postoperatively, the patient was found to have a right fixed mid-dilated pupil, flaccid paralysis of the left arm and leg with hyperreflexia throughout the left side. Computed tomography (CT) of the head revealed a right midbrain and thalamic stroke thought to be secondary to transient arrhythmia-induced hypoperfusion, intraoperatively.\nOn postoperative day number three, after AICD placement and stroke, the patient acutely developed a rigid distended board-like abdomen with dullness to percussion. Vitals at that time were temperature, 98.4 degrees Fahrenheit; blood pressure, 112/67 mmHg; heart rate range, 55 beats per minute, and respiratory rate 26 on ventilator settings of assist control volume control with a rate of 26; tidal volume, 500 ml; FiO2, 40% and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5. His peak inspiratory pressure on the ventilator had risen from 26 to 72 mmHg; his plateau had risen from 15 to 48 mmHg with oxygen desaturation from 93 to 85%. The patient had received 1.5 l in and urinated 4.5 l over the 24 hours, leading up to this event. His laboratory values from that morning were unchanged from previous (white blood count, 10 400/\u03bcl; haemoglobin, 12.6 g/dl; platelets, 200 000/\u03bcl; sodium, 139 mEq/l; potassium, 4.7 mEq/l; chloride, 100 mEq/l; bicarbonate, 34 mEq/l; BUN, 36 mg/dl; creatinine, 1.41 mg/dl; glucose, 78 mg/dl; calcium, 8.3 mg/dl; magnesium, 2.0 mEq/l; phosphorus, 3.0 mg/dl; AST, 77 U/l; ALT, 94 U/l; alkaline phosphatase, 186 U/l; total bilirubin, 1.3 mg/dl). This constellation of findings prompted the team to measure an abdominal compartment pressure which was elevated to 53 cm H2O (40 mmHg) with an abdominal perfusion pressure (APP) of 42 mmHg. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed which showed no dilated loops of bowel, no ileus, no evidence of free air, abscess or obstruction and minimal free fluid []. Pertinent labs from the event revealed a lactate of 1.0 mg/dl; lipase, 159 U/l; amylase, 76 U/l; creatinine, 1.53 mg/dl. Surgery was consulted and the FiO2 was increased to 100%, which improved his oxygen saturation to 96% despite his elevated peak inspiratory pressures.\nSurgical recommendations were for an emergent bedside surgical abdominal decompression. The patient was administered 10 mg of intravenous cisatracurium besylate by anaesthesia in preparation for surgical management. Shortly following paralytic administration, his peak inspiratory pressure corrected from 72 to 23 mmHg, his plateau pressure from 48 to 16 mmHg and his oxygenation status tolerated a decrease in FiO2 down to 40% with his oxygen saturation returning to baseline. Measurement of his abdominal compartment pressure revealed a drop from 53 (40 mmHg) to 23 cm H2O (17 mmHg) and then normalised to 15 cm H20 (11 mmHg) over a three-hour period. During this entire event, the patient averaged 100 to 200 cc/hr of urine output and laboratory values from the following day showed a drop in creatinine from 1.53 to 1.29 mg/dl. Given this correction, surgical management was postponed and the patient was monitored. The patient remained hospitalised for an additional 73 days.

He was a smoker with diabetes and chronic kidney disease Class 3a with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 48 mL/min/m2. The hospital had no coronary intervention facilities, so he received thrombolytic therapy. Two weeks later, he presented to our emergency department with typical chest pain and exertional dyspnoea (New York Heart Association Class III). He was on dual antiplatelet therapy, Bisoprolol, Atorvastatin, and Isosorbide dinitrates. There was no echocardiogram report with the patient.\nAuscultation confirmed a harsh pansystolic murmur V/VI on his left parasternal area and across the precordium. He had bilateral, fine basal crepitations. His heart rate was 88 b.p.m. and blood pressure was 115/67 mmHg.\nTransthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and transoesophageal echocardiogram (TOE) demonstrated an akinetic inferior wall and inferior septum with an ejection fraction (EF) of 45%. A large, true aneurysm in the mid-cavity inferior wall was identified by its wide neck and contracting muscle layer ( and ). The inferior septum was ruptured and dissected with a large, left-to-right shunt ( and ). A TOE X-plane transgastric short-axis view in diastole showed an inferior wall aneurysm with a wide neck of 2 cm (). The aneurysm cavity connected to the RV through the ruptured part of the inferior septum, creating an LV-to-RV-to-aneurysm communication ( and ). We noted mild tricuspid regurgitation with an estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure of 75 mmHg. RV function was mildly reduced (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion of 1.6 cm). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed non-viable inferior segments, and a 4.2 cm \u00d7 4.3 cm \u00d7 5.8 cm cavitary lesion. The LV showed a mid-inferior and inferoseptal wide-neck true aneurysm () with a focal area of ventricular septal rupture in the inferior aspect of the aneurysm with a turbulent high-velocity flow across it (). The patient\u2019s coronary angiography displayed tight proximal and middle right coronary artery lesions, as well as a severe ostial left main, a severe mid-left anterior descending artery lesion, and severe ramus intermedius disease.\nThe patient was considered high surgical risk because of his age, general condition, renal impairment, and difficult anatomy of the post-infarct VSD and aneurysm. Transcatheter closure of the post-infarct VSD and inferior wall aneurysm was performed. Because of the two different pathologies, we closed the VSD first using an antegrade approach from the venous side. Next, we closed the neck of the aneurysm using a retrograde approach from the arterial side. A Terumo guidewire (260 cm) was introduced from the right common femoral vein. The wire passed from the RV to the inferior wall aneurysm to the LV and finally to the aorta. We then exchanged the Terumo guidewire with an Amplatzer stiff guidewire (260 cm).\nWe used an 8 French Amplatzer delivery sheath to deploy an 18-mm ASO (AGA Medical Corporation, USA) to close the VSD completely (, and ). We selected the size based on TOE measurements. The RV-to-aneurysm communication measured 14 mm, so we oversized the ASO device by 4 mm to fit inside the defect. The aneurysm was engaged in retrograde from the LV using a 6 French PG catheter introduced from the right common femoral artery and over the Terumo guidewire (260 cm), which was then replaced by a Confida stiff guidewire (Medtronic) of the same length. We cannulated the inferior aneurysm mouth with a Torque-Vue 10 F/45 delivery sheath. The ASO (26 mm) device was deployed with a large disc in the aneurysm (, and ). We selected the size based on the TOE measurement. The aneurysm mouth measured 20 mm, so we increased the ASO length by 6 mm to fit inside the aneurysm. We assured enough distance between the aneurysm mouth and the mitral valve so that the deployed disc would not affect the mitral valve. Both devices were established with the aneurysm device resting on the post-infarct VSD device ( and ).\nLeft ventricular (LV) injection and TOE showed complete occlusion of the post-infarct VSD and aneurysm. Both devices established contact and showed the angulated relation of their two different planes (, and ). The akinetic inferior wal procedure and fluoroscopy times were 60 min and 25 min, respectively, and the total contrast amount was 40 mL. The patient recovered uneventfully within 6 days in the intensive care unit. As EF was 45%, we selected to do full revascularization. The patient underwent complete revascularization for his right coronary artery, left main artery, proximal left anterior descending artery, and ramus intermedius (). The patient was discharged after 14 days. At his 3-month follow-up, he remained well with reasonable exercise tolerance, NYHA Class I.

{"Row Number": 82, "Calculator Name": "Body Mass Index (BMI)", "Calculator ID": "6", "Note ID": "pmc-8131347-1", "Patient Note": "A 76-year-old woman presented at our outpatient clinic with symptomatic OA of the right knee. At admission her height was measured to be 139.8 cm and her weight was measured to be 46.5 kg. Her past medical history included NF, congenital pseudarthrosis, and combined deformities of the tibia and fibula that resulted in the shortening of the right lower limb. At presentation, her examination revealed a limited active range of motion at the right knee joint (from 0 to 90\u00b0), a valgus deformity of 14\u00b0 using the femoro-tibial angle measurement, severe pain, and a progressively worsening antalgic gait due to the preexisting limb shortening. These deformities, including pseudoarthrosis, are consistent with skeletal deformities previously described in patients diagnosed with NF. She was diagnosed with Grade 4 OA as per the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) classification based on the results of radiographic imaging and the physical examination (). Her walking distance was limited due to pain. Passive range of motion studies revealed significant hyperextension (\u221210\u00b0) consistent with an increased risk for dislocation. The physical exam also revealed peroneal nerve palsy and caf\u00e9 au-lait spots across her entire body, the latter finding indicative of advanced NF. She had previously undergone a bone transplant at the fibula with a graft taken from the tibia approximately 50 years prior; as such, there was only a limited amount of viable bone remaining to support the successful implantation of a prosthesis. As there was not sufficient viable bone stock available to support the ready-made intramedullary stem used in total knee arthroplasty (TKA; ), our initial plan was to perform a bicompartmental knee arthroplasty (BKA). Furthermore, as part of the preoperative procedure at our hospital, we conducted a bone density test. This evaluation revealed a femoral bone density of 0.525 g/cm3, which affirmed our decision to avoid a TKA, as the quality of the available bone stock would unlikely be sufficient to support adequate fixation of the larger implants required in this procedure. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was performed to provide maximum visualization of the lesion, given the discrepancies in the anatomical structures and also to evaluate the soft tissue condition (). Although a bicompartmental knee implant was templated, the cartilage on the medial side of the joint was found to be intact on the coronal MRI scan, thereby presenting a contraindication to this procedure (). Additional radiographic studies revealed that the patient had both femoral and tibial insufficiency and a significant reduction in the bone stock available for the positioning of an implant that required a tibial stem. As this patient also exhibited problems with osteogenesis due to NF, all procedures were planned with the goal of limiting the degree of tissue damage. With this in mind, we considered unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) as a minimally invasive procedure that might be used for the successful amelioration of her OA symptoms. A lateral UKA to fix the valgus deformity was discussed with the patient as a means to provide adequate relief from the pain resulting from the bone-on-bone contact at the lateral side as well as to address the problem of hyperextension. The patient agreed to this course of action. Preoperative planning focused on addressing the issues associated with bone-on-bone contact as well as repair of the valgus deformity with the goal of promoting stability at the knee. The range of motion was verified preoperatively, and femoral and tibial contact points were mapped across the full range of motion to determine the degree of the anterior slope. Unfortunately, the dimensions of the anterior slope precluded the use of an implant of the size that would be desirable given the patient\u2019s tibial dimensions. We were also aware of the fact that the risks of dislocation are increased in NF patients due to characteristic joint hypermobility and problems with soft tissue in areas such as the skin, menisci, and musculature.\nDuring surgery, the surrounding tissue was debrided, and a large fragment of debris was removed from the joint space. Visual inspection of the knee confirmed the diagnosis of isolated lateral OA with intact medial articulation (). A femoral unicompartmental knee system (Physica ZUK; size D) implant and a 29 mm \u00d7 50 mm tibial implant (Zimmer\u00ae) were inserted. Perioperative radiographs revealed that, although the trial implant was slightly larger than ideal, synchronous soft tissue balance of the knee was confirmed (). Unfortunately, as customized implants were not available, space remained between the femoral implant and the femoral condyle.\nPrior to final fixation, the articulation site was copiously irrigated to facilitate the penetration of cement into the femur and tibia. The final implant was then inserted into small holes that were drilled into the tibia and femur that also facilitated cement adhesion. The cement was molded to fill the gap observed during the trial implantation ().\nPostoperative imaging and physical examination revealed that the anterior tibial slope was repaired and that the valgus deformity was reduced to 5\u00b0 from the 14\u00b0 determined preoperatively (). The patient was capable of ambulation within 24 hours after completion of the procedure. However, the patient developed a varus thrust and continued to require epidural analgesia for 48 hours after the procedure. The rehabilitation plan included assisted range of motion and partial weight-bearing walking exercises. The patient exhibited a myopathic gait; this was deemed acceptable given her preexisting musculoskeletal condition. One week after the procedure, the patient continued to ambulate with the assistance of two walking poles and a knee brace. She reported that soreness developed after walking for approximately 20 meters; this was attributed to preoperative muscle stiffness (). The active range of motion extended from 0 to 110\u00b0; this represented a significant improvement over her preoperative range of 0 to 90\u00b0. Ankle movement was restricted due to preexisting peroneal nerve palsy and mild pain was present after the surgery. The most substantial functional gains from the lateral UKA procedure were the improvements in the knee alignment and the reduction in the valgus deformity. Both of these corrections contributed to significant improvements in patient ambulation.\nTwo weeks after the procedure, the patient experienced a fall that resulted in a stress fracture of the tibial plateau. The lesion was diagnosed as a proximal oblique fracture of the tibia. This was most likely due to a mismatch between the implant and patient-specific mechano-physiology which may have potentially resulted in sagittal overcutting. The tibial UKA component was not displaced (). Three days post-fracture, a surgical procedure involving a locking plate was planned. A distal tibia anterolateral plate (A.L.P.S\u00ae) with nine holes was rotated upside down to achieve successful fixation of the fracture. Eight locking cortical screws were inserted; postoperative imaging documented adequate fixation and support (). Given the high risk for dislocations, continuous passive motion therapy was contraindicated. Within five days after the second procedure, the patient reported only minimal pain and was able to undergo successful rehabilitation to improve her range of motion. We note that her participation in the standard rehabilitation program was interrupted due to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This was unfortunate, as adequate postoperative rehabilitation can be critical for recovery. The patient was provided with a fixed knee brace to stabilize her leg during the first two months after the insertion of the locking plate. As the COVID-19 pandemic was then under adequate control in the region, the patient was able to follow a rehabilitation plan that included both passive and active progressive range of motion exercises, partial weight-bearing walking regimens, and measures designed to manage pain and swelling. The patient was put on a partial weight-bearing walking regimen (30% to start, gradually increased to 100% body weight every week) beginning at one week postoperatively. At the two-month postoperative checkup, the patient was able to walk with a full weight load without assistance (). Four months after the procedure, the patient reported significant improvements with respect to pain and active range of motion. The patient returned to her activities of daily life and did not need a knee brace or supporter (). Radiographic images revealed callus formation at the fracture site, indicative of new bone formation. We planned to follow this patient on a more long-term basis to manage pain and swelling and to maintain the improved range of motion and weight-bearing capability. However, the overall impact of COVID-19 limited the extent to which we could follow this patient after the five-month check-up. Nonetheless, the patient planned to continue with the prescribed rehabilitation plan. The patient presented for a 7-month postoperative checkup and reported some residual pain that she managed effectively with the pain medication regimen that was prescribed. She reported that she was able to walk on most days and carry out day-to-day activities without difficulty. On certain days, she noted some instability at her knee joint which is likely attributable to the postoperative fracture. Further radiographic studies revealed appropriate fracture healing, and her physical exam documented appropriate knee alignment.\nAlthough the patient was capable of ambulation prior to the UKA procedure, she relied on external support and experienced substantial pain due to osteoarthritis and poor knee alignment. The contraindications to a conventional TKA outweighed the possible benefits that might be achieved in this case. A UKA seemed to be a more appropriate solution toward resolving the pain resulting from bone-on-bone contact and the valgus deformity. The UKA procedure is less invasive, maintains the kinematics at the knee, preserves more bone, and facilitates easier revision surgery if this becomes necessary.\nThe decision to perform a UKA was controversial due to the unique complexities associated with this patient. However, these therapeutic modalities resulted in a significant improvement in the patient\u2019s quality of life. This outcome was evaluated quantitatively by the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) which is included in the (). An increase of 8\u201310 points on the KOOS total score has been clearly established as a clinically significant improvement. Our patient exhibited a 23.2-point increase in KOOS in response to treatment. This finding indicates that the patient experienced significant benefit from the complete treatment plan. Specifically, the patient reported improvements in areas including but not limited to, a reduction in pain, reduced stiffness, improved mobility, and a better quality of life.", "Question": "What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

The patient had suffered difficulties in walking from weakening of both lower limb muscles since 25 years ago, and recently the symptom of weakness of lower limb muscles became more serious and dyspnea at the level of ATS (American Thoracic Society) Dyspnea Grade I had occurred due to the weakening of the respiratory root. A molecular genetics examination conducted at another hospital discovered a deficit of the SMN1 gene, and considering the time of onset and clinical conditions, the patient was diagnosed with type IV spinal muscular atrophy. The patient stood 168 cm and weighed 63 kg, and there were no special opinions from ECG and simple radioactive examination before operation. Arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) showed pH 7.435, PaO2 74.6 mmHg, PaCO2 36.9 mmHg, and HCO3- 24.2 mmHg. The patient was under drug treatment for hypertension. Administration before anesthesia was not conducted and vital signs examined after going into the operating room were blood pressure: 160/100 mmHg; respiration rate per minute: 20 times; ECG: normal sinus rhythm; and pulse oxymetry: 98%. From a manual muscle test before operation, both legs were at the 4th stage. At the genupectoral position, the epidural space was identified by loss of resistance technique using an 18 G Tuohy insertion needle in between the L2-L3 lumbar, and after a test dose injection of 1.5% lidocaine 3 ml containing 1 : 200,000 epinephrine, no increase of heart rate or spinal anesthesia symptom was detected. After injecting 0.75% ropivacaine 12 ml, a catheter was placed and maintained. To measure the level of motor block by time after anesthesia, a modified Bromage scale (0: One can stretch and raise his/her leg; 1: One cannot raise his/her leg and cannot bend his/her knee; 2: One cannot his/her knee but can bend his/her ankle; 3: One cannot bend his/her ankle) was applied.\nThe level of modified Bromage scale before anesthesia was 1, and 20 minutes after injecting ropivacaine, the level of modified Bromage scale was 3. The sensory nerves were blocked by T8 segment on pinprick examination. Vital signs during operation were blood pressure: 120-140/60-80 mmHg and pulse rate per minute: stable at 70-80 times. A Venti\u00ae mask with 35% of oxygen fraction in inspired air was used, and an ETCO2 capnometer was placed under the nose of the patient to monitor the end-tidal CO2. ETCO2 was stable at 35 mmHg and the pulse oxymetry was 100%. Due to the risk of aspiration of saliva or bronchial secretion during operation, sedation was not operated. The surgery was operated for an hour, and the epidural catheter was removed after operation. After finishing the operation, the level of modified Bromage scale was 3 and the sensory nerve block was decreased up to the T9 segment. Three hours after the operation, the level of modified Bromage scale was dropped to 2 and the sensory nerve block to the T11 segment; 5 hours after the operation, the stage of modified Bromage scale was 1, and the sensory nerve was declined to the L1 segment. Since the patient did not show adverse effects including vomiting, nausea, and dizziness in the recovery room, he was moved to a patient room. Twelve hours after finishing the operation, both the level of the modified Bromage scale and sensory nerve were recovered to the condition before operation, and also for the manual muscle test, both legs were maintained at the 4th stage.

When he was being treated for pneumonia at another hospital, CT image incidentally revealed a BT and mild right-sided hydronephrosis (Fig. ) without metastasis. After his pneumonia had been cured, the patient was referred to the SIMC to receive treatment for his BT (SIMC-Uro# 11116, a unique non-sequential patient control number issued at the Department of Uro-Oncology, SIMC). At his first visit, the patient's physical (height: 1.56 m, weight: 48.9 kg) and routine laboratory data were within the normal ranges. He had been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, which required regular insulin injections. MRI showed many BTs (Figs \u2013). The largest tumor detected on MRI is indicated by the blue arrowhead in Figure a. The tumor indicated by the yellow arrowhead was observed as it progressed between the right ureteral wall (white arrowhead in Figure a) and bladder wall (red arrowhead). Moreover, a tumor was found within the right orifice of the ureter (green arrowhead), which had presumably caused the mild right-sided hydroureter (\u201cu\u201d in Figure a, see also Figures \u2013). Thus, the patient was diagnosed with bladder carcinoma, which was suspected to have infiltrated into the ureter (green arrowhead). No apparent muscle invasion, lymph node metastasis, or distant metastasis was observed (clinical classification: T1, N0, M0, according to the classification of the Union for International Cancer Control).\nThe patient underwent oral-PDD-TUR-BT (20 mg/kg of 5-ALA was administered 2 hours before surgery) using the D-LIGHT system (Table ). As suggested by MRI (blue arrowhead in Figure a), the main papillary tumor was located on the right ureteral orifice (blue arrowhead in Figure b), and it clearly emitted fluorescence under blue light (Fig. c). It had invaded the bladder neck, the prostatic urethra, and the right posterior wall of the bladder (Video ). In addition, three daughter tumors were found on the posterior wall of the bladder (Video ). Random bladder biopsy samples were obtained from the surrounding normal tissue (the posterior, left, and right walls) and the tumor-infiltrated tissue (the bladder neck and prostatic urethra). Subsequently, we deeply resected the largest tumor (Fig. b,c). The right ureteral orifice was exposed, and it was found to have been blocked by papillary tumors (the tumors in the ureter and the ureteral wall are indicated by green and white arrowheads, respectively; Fig. d,e). We deeply resected the tumors in the ureteral orifice; however, after the resection procedure residual tumors were identified within the ureteral orifice (green arrowhead in Figure f), which emitted potent fluorescence under blue light (Fig. g, see also Video ). We decided to attempt to remove the remaining tumors. After the second and third attempts to resect the ureteral tumors (deep resections, Video ), no tumors were visible under white light in the right ureter (Fig. h); however, marked fluorescence was observed from the ureteral mucosa (Fig. i), which was indicative of residual cancer. If the patient had undergone TUR without PDD, we would have finished the surgery at this point. Instead, we performed a biopsy of the fluorescence-emitting tissue. We then attempted to remove the suspected residual carcinoma. After the fourth resection of the ureteral orifice, the hydroureter-affected lumen was exposed, the mucosa of which was smooth and did not emit fluorescence (Fig. j,k). Subsequently, we performed a biopsy of the ureteral mucosa (Video ).\nThe pathological diagnosis of the BT was low-grade urothelial carcinoma, which had not invaded the muscular layer (pTa). No cancer cells were detected in random biopsy specimens. As expected from the PDD, low-grade cancer cells were detected in the ureteral mucosa after the third resection of the ureteral orifice, in which an irregular and fluorescent mucosa was identified (Fig. h,i). On the other hand, no cancer cells were found in the smooth and non-fluorescent mucosa after the fourth resection procedure. To prevent tumor recurrence, the patient is currently being treated with intravesically administered BCG via a right ureteral stent, which exposes both the ureter and the bladder to BCG. We concluded that the ureteral tumor was a BT that had infiltrated into the ureter because (i) preoperative MRI (Fig. a) showed that the main tumor was located in the bladder, (ii) the hydronephrosis was mild (CT findings, Figure ; the hydronephrosis would have been severe if the ureteral tumor had originated from the ureteral orifice), and (iii) the pathological analyses did not show muscular invasion.

She weighed 42 kg and was 137 cm in height. Treatment for asthma that had been initiated about 1 month before had not improved her respiratory condition. She presented with marked stridor and cough, severe intercostal and subcostal chest retraction, and developed acute respiratory distress. Her parents mentioned that her respiratory condition might have been worsened by an external traumatic event at the neck that had been caused by her younger brother a few months earlier. At that time, while she had been playing with her younger brother, his elbow had bumped into her neck violently.\nOn admission, computed tomography (CT) of the neck showed that severe subglottic stenosis has developed with minimal cross-sectional diameters of 3.5 \u00d7 1.8 mm at the narrowest point (0.05 cm2) (Fig. ). Laryngoscopy revealed that her airway was almost completely obstructed by severe subglottic stenosis. Findings from other preoperative investigations including laboratory tests, chest X-ray, and electrocardiography were normal. The preoperative vital signs were blood pressure of 120/59 mmHg, temperature of 37.5 \u00b0C, respiratory rate of 20/min, and SpO2 of 98% (O2 5 L/min via mask). Because the cause of the severe subglottic stenosis was unclear and her symptoms were worsening day by day, we decided to perform emergency tracheostomy to prevent further worsening of her symptoms and a life-threatening condition.\nThe case was discussed in detail among otolaryngologists and anesthesiologists. Because we anticipated intubation to be impossible, emergency tracheostomy was planned. She was transferred to the operation room for emergency tracheostomy. Intraoperatively, the girl was monitored for oxygen saturation, end-tidal carbon dioxide, and non-invasive blood pressure, with electrocardiography performed as well.\nWe judged that it would be difficult to obtain the patient\u2019s cooperation with only regional anesthesia. Emergent tracheostomy was therefore planned under general anesthesia. Sevoflurane was administered with sufficient titration to maintain spontaneous breathing. Anesthesia was maintained via the inhalation of air, oxygen, and sevoflurane. We considered that the use of a face mask instead of supraglottic airway devices during anesthesia might minimize the risk of tracheal injury or laryngospasm. The lungs were fully preoxygenated. The sevoflurane concentration was increased to 3%, at which point the patient was unresponsive.\nThe patient initially continued breathing spontaneously, but ventilation later became impossible because the otolaryngologists pulled her trachea. Before the oxygenation and hemodynamics became unstable, tracheostomy was successfully performed by the otolaryngologists. The patient was admitted to our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for postoperative airway management.\nOn postoperative day (POD) 3, because her airway had been stabilized by tracheostomy, she was discharged from the PICU. On POD 4, CT of the neck still showed narrowing of the subglottic portion. On POD 7, a laryngoscope under general anesthesia revealed severe edema at the subglottic stenosis (Fig. ). The otolaryngologists considered that the cause of the subglottic stenosis might be edema due to cricoid fracture, given her medical history.\nAt five months after surgery, a laryngoscope was again inserted under general anesthesia, revealing large granulomas surrounding an object in the subglottic wall. Surprisingly, this object turned out to be a circular plastic foreign body (cross-sectional diameter of 1.2 \u00d7 1.0 cm) (Fig. ). Surgery was performed to remove the object. On showing the foreign body to the patient and her parents, they did not remember her aspirating the object.

{"Row Number": 92, "Calculator Name": "Body Mass Index (BMI)", "Calculator ID": "6", "Note ID": "pmc-5576131-1", "Patient Note": "A 30-year-old G4, P2 female, 160 cm tall, and weighing 68 kg, was admitted at 38 weeks of her third gestation for vaginal bleeding and hypogastralgia at her local hospital. Due to the combination of hypoxemia and abnormal electrocardiograph (ECG) findings, she was advised to transfer to our hospital; the patient did not receive prenatal obstetric care in our hospital. The admitting diagnosis was cardiac insufficiency, cyanotic CHD (dubious) and scarred uterus. The physical examination revealed blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, a pulse of 90/min, a respiratory rate of 25/min, slightly cyanotic lips and the same on her cheeks, coarse breath sounds to auscultation in the lungs, and a regular heartbeat. A loud P2 and grade 3/6 systolic murmur was heard at the third and fourth ribs on the left edge of the sternum. The ECG showed sinus rhythm, complete right bundle branch block (CRBBB), first degree A-V block, inverted T wave, right ventricular hypertrophy, and severe cardiac clockwise rotation.\nThe obstetricians felt that the manifestations of cardiac insufficiency in the mother put her at high risk in a vaginal delivery. The fetus presented with abnormal heart rate variability, with no further evidence that the fetus was in a state of emergency. Considering that the mother had been in a condition of hypoxia, which would result in hypoxia in the baby, the obstetricians recommended emergency cesarean section for the benefit of both the mother and the baby.\nThe patient was transferred to the operating theater with a temperature of 36.8 \u00b0C, a heart rate of 92 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 23breaths/min, a blood pressure of 138/88 mmHg, and an oxygen saturation of 83-90% in air. With the administration of a fractional inspired concentration of oxygen (FiO2) of 0.5 to 0.6 via a Venturi mask, the patient\u2019s oxygen saturation increased from 88 to 92%. Peripheral venous access was sited, and a 400-ml bolus of compound sodium chloride was commenced, after which a radial arterial line was placed under local anesthesia for beat-to-beat blood pressure monitoring.\nCombined spinal-epidural anesthesia (single-shot spinal anesthesia) was administered in this case. The puncture point of spinal anesthesia was selected in the L2-3 interspace, and the procedure was performed using a needle-through-needle technique in the left lateral decubitus position. After cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could be slowly aspirated through the needle, doses of 1.4 ml of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine made up with 10% glucose for a hyperbaric solution that made it easy to adjust and control the anesthetic plane were injected into the subarachnoid space slowly towards the head, and an epidural catheter was inserted into the epidural space. The patient was then placed in the supine position with a left lateral tilt of at least 30 degrees; [] the patient\u2019s abdomen could be raised softly if necessary to relieve vena caval compression. Within 20 min later of the anesthetic injection, we tested the block height every 1-2 min and adjusted the head-up or head-down tilt position to strictly control the blockade under the level of T6-8. Twenty minutes later, the level of spinal block was static at T8. One minute later, the patient was returned to the supine position, with a slight decrease arterial pressure to 122/82 mmHg and a heart rate of 97 beats/min. As small doses of metaraminol could resist the vasodilatation caused by anesthesia to maintain the afterload, 100 \u03bcg of metaraminol was administered, after which the patient\u2019s arterial pressure increased to 130/84 mmHg, with a heart rate of 91 beats/min.\nDuring the entire procedure, the key for safely administering anesthesia on such a patient was to keep her blood pressure stable and to carefully address the side effects of the changes in the hemodynamics []. Because the spinal anesthesia took action faster and due to the rapid sympathectomy in the intra-vertebral anesthesia, great care should be taken of the changes in arterial pressure and heart rate after puncture and injection.\nA male baby was smoothly delivered 10 min after the surgery began; the baby had Apgar scores of 8 at 1 min and 9 at 5 min. In addition to the caution that must be paid due to the change in the patient\u2019s venous return at the time of the delivery of the baby, some factors need to be given attention to avoid the occurrence of great amounts of intra-cardiac shunt changes and even heart failure. First, because the oppression of the inferior vena cava was relieved after childbirth, the lower limb venous blood flow increased rapidly, and the venous return increased in a short amount of time as a result. Abdominal sandbags were adopted to add pressure to reduce the returned blood volume. Further, the maternal \u201cautologous blood transfusion effect\u201d had to be considered: after the fetus was delivered, the myometrium contracted, and intrauterine blood flowed back to the blood vessels rapidly, thereby increasing the cardiac preload in a short amount of time. If the initial transfusion was too great, it could lead to heart failure. According to the patient\u2019s fluctuations in blood pressure, a bolus of ephedrine 3 mg or metaraminol 100 \u03bcg was used to restore the blood pressure to 130 ~ 140/82 ~ 87 mmHg, with a heart rate of 90 ~ 98 beats/min and an SpO2 of 89 ~ 93% during the surgery. The goal was to balance the preload and afterload and to try to maintain the intra-cardiac shunt in the preoperative level of stability.\nUterine atony was noted by the surgeon after delivery of the placenta. Oxytocin is usually administered to increase the contractions so as to reduce bleeding; however, a rapid infusion of oxytocin could increase the patient\u2019s heart rate, reduce the cardiac output and coronary blood flow, and break the balance of the intra-cardiac shunt, which could lead to cardiac insufficiency. Therefore, the application of oxytocin must begin with small doses, and the dosage should be adjusted over time. Thus, oxytocin (10 mIU/min) was intravenously infused, and the infusion was adjusted in accordance with the patient\u2019s changes in heart rate and blood pressure. Continuous post-cesarean analgesia was provided through an epidural catheter. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and was then sent to the ward in stable condition the following day.\nWe advised the patient to have an echocardiogram examination, which revealed CHD, a single atrium, and defects of the endocardial cushions (Fig. ). Thus, we made a complementary diagnosis of CHD: single atrium. The patient was in good condition at the 6-month follow-up.", "Question": "What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

{"Row Number": 93, "Calculator Name": "Body Mass Index (BMI)", "Calculator ID": "6", "Note ID": "pmc-5783153-1", "Patient Note": "A 67-year-old man with a height of 183 cm and a weight of 105 kg was admitted for urgent resection of a left atrial mass. He presented with progressive heart failure that could not be alleviated by inotropic or vasodilating drugs and had been coughing for 10 days. The symptoms had aggravated, and he had been unable to keep supine position for the last 3 days. He denied any previous heart disease. He had a history of right elbow leiomyosarcoma and underwent resection surgery 1 year previously.\nOn physical examination, the patient showed orthopnea and a compulsive position of slight left tilting. Wet rales could be heard on bilateral lung base. III/6 diastolic rumble was heard through the apex of the heart, which attenuated with upright position.\nThe preoperative laboratory data were within normal limits, except for NT-proBNP 1,190 pg/L. The electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia and minor ST segment change. Chest X-ray demonstrated prominent pulmonary patches infiltration, suggesting possible pulmonary edema. A mass was noted on the left lung. Combined with the malignancy history of the patient, pulmonary metastasis was suspected, whereas primary pulmonary tumor could not be ruled out (). Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a mobile isoechoic to hyperechoic lumpy mass (54\u00d727 mm, ) and medium pulmonary hypertension (67 mmHg), and the ejection fraction of the left ventricle was 65%.\nAccording to symptoms of left-sided heart failure, signs of mitral stenosis, and ultrasound imaging, myxoma was highly suspected. The TTE image indicated that the mass originated from the posterior wall of the left atrium (the typical myxoma is pedunculated with a stalk commonly attached to the fossa ovalis of interatrial septum). Differential diagnoses included idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH), pulmonary embolism, pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There is not enough evidence to support the differential diagnoses above.\nIn the operating room, monitors consisting of noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), five-lead electrocardiogram, and pulse oximetry (SpO2) were applied. Radial arterial line and central venous catheter in the right subclavian vein were inserted, and then, arterial blood pressure (ABP) and central venous pressure (CVP) were monitored. Vital signs of the patient were basically stable with continuous intravenous nitroglycerin at the rate of 0.5 \u03bcg/kg/min. ABP was 121/82 mmHg, and CVP was 8 cmH2O, while heart rate (HR) was 111 bpm. His SpO2 was 92%\u201393% (fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO2] 60%). Airway assessment indicated several risk factors: obesity, short neck, impaired neck mobility, and Mallampati classification grade III. When the patient was awake with topical anesthesia of the tongue and pharynx, partial glottis was observed (Cormack\u2013Lehane 2b) with direct laryngoscope. Thus, we considered the mask ventilation was feasible and anesthesia induction was conducted. After preoxygenation with oxygen (10 L/min) for 5 min via a face mask, general anesthesia was induced using Renfushufen\u00ae (sufentanil) 1 \u03bcg/kg, etomidate 0.15 mg/kg, and rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg (ideal body weight). Orotracheal intubation was performed with video laryngoscope when the patient was kept in the 60\u00b0 Semi-Fowler\u2019s position to avoid circulation collapse. Because mitral valve occlusion by left atrial mass may result in low cardiac output. Volume-controlled ventilation was applied (tidal volume of 8 mL/kg, frequency adjusted to maintain partial pressure of carbon dioxide in artery [PaCO2] between 35 and 45 mmHg, and inspiratory/expiratory (I/E) ratio 1:2). The airway peak pressure was 28\u201330 cmH2O. After intubation, the SpO2 was only 90%\u201393% (FiO2 60%). Arterial gas analysis during surgery is shown in . Abnormalities of airway, breathing, drug effects, and equipment were not found; thus, pulmonary edema was considered as the main reason for hypoxia. FiO2 100% was provided to improve oxygenation. Respiratory rate was increased to enhance minute ventilation volume. Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) was supplied to prevent alveoli from collapsing to improve pulmonary compliance and gas exchange and to decrease extravascular lung water. PEEP was titrated to 6 cmH2O to avoid high PEEP-related compromise preload. Then, SpO2 improved to 94%\u201395%. Vital signs and ventilation parameters during surgery are shown in . Anesthesia was maintained with sufentanil 20 \u03bcg/h and sevoflurane 2%\u20132.5% (concentration of sevoflurane was adjusted according to the patient\u2019s increased age), and rocuronium was given intermittently.\nAfter median sternotomy, 400 U/kg heparin was administered. Arterial cannulation was performed via ascending aorta. Venous cannulation was inserted via the right atrial appendage into the superior and inferior vena cava. After CPB was established, oxygenation of the patient improved significantly with the SpO2 improved to 99%\u2013100%. The patient was kept anesthetized with midazolam 0.1 mg/kg/h, sufentanil 0.15 \u03bcg/kg/h, and rocuronium 0.15 mg/kg/h intravenously under hypothermic CPB, and nasopharyngeal and rectal temperature were maintained at 25\u00b0C and 28\u00b0C, respectively. Activated clotting time (ACT) was performed intermittently, and the results are shown in .\nUnder direct view, the mass was large and occupied nearly the entire left atrium. The right atrium and atrial septum were incised, and the mass was found attached by a stalk to the opening of the left superior pulmonary vein. The mass in the left atrium was totally resected, and was 15\u00d72 cm. The tumor in the left superior pulmonary vein could not be completely resected, and palliative resection of the tumor around the opening of the left superior pulmonary vein was performed to ease tumor-related symptoms. As a result, preload was improved while pulmonary hypertension remained a problem. After rewarming and deairing of the heart, the aortic cross-clamp was removed. The heart came back into sinus rhythm with 20J intracardiac defibrillation, and then, the CPB was discontinued gradually. Weaning was facilitated with norepinephrine 0.05 \u03bcg/kg/min and dopamine 5 \u03bcg/kg/min to achieve goal mean arterial BP.65 mmHg. Nitroglycerin 0.5\u20130.8 \u03bcg/kg/min was used to decrease systemic vascular resistance. A total of 800 mL of packed red blood cells were gradually infused to increase preload. Vital signs showed an ABP of 110/70 mmHg, an HR of 110 bpm, a CVP of 12 cmH2O, and an SpO2 of 93%\u201395%. Heparin was neutralized with protamine (1 mg/100 U heparin). The total CPB time was 100 min, and the aortic occlusion time was 85 min. The overall fluid balance during CPB was \u22122,700 mL. The estimated blood loss was 800 mL. Arterial blood gas analysis after CPB discontinuation is also showed in .\nAfter CPB, the partial pressure of oxygen in artery (PaO2) was 68 mmHg with FiO2 100% and PEEP 6 cmH2O and was increased from that before tumor resection (48 mmHg). After excluding bronchospasm and acute lung injury, we assumed that this was due to unrelieved cardiogenic pulmonary edema and pulmonary hypertension, as well as residual tumor in the pulmonary vessels. Inotropic agents including epinephrine 0.05 \u03bcg/kg/min, dopamine 5 \u03bcg/kg/min, and nitroglycerin 0.5\u20130.8 \u03bcg/kg/min were continuously used to improve cardiac output and facilitate stable hemodynamics, so as to alleviate pulmonary edema. Hyperventilation was applied to decrease PaCO2 and prevent acidosis. Hypoxia pulmonary vasoconstriction may have been partially inhibited, and pulmonary artery systolic pressure was decreased from 67 to <35 mmHg (postoperative TTE). The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit with BP 110/71 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, and SpO2 95% during admission. Oxygenation was improved compared to the level before left atrial tumor resection (91 vs 48 mmHg), and HR was decreased (103 vs 111 bpm), indicating that pulmonary edema was partially relieved. Increasing FiO2, decreasing O2 consumption, and optimizing acid\u2013base balance and hemoglobin, together with protective ventilation, were provided and resulted in oxygenation improvement. Vasoactive medications and mechanical ventilation were gradually weaned, and vital signs remained stable. Chest X-ray performed 3 h postoperatively revealed significantly relieved pulmonary edema (). The patient was extubated on postoperative day 4 while he was conscious, and the vital signs showed BP 121/72 mmHg, HR 72 bpm, and SpO2 95%\u201397% with FiO2 85%. He was discharged 10 days after the surgery with symptoms ameliorated and SpO2 97% with FiO2 21%. Histopathological examination of the resected lesion revealed features consistent with leiomyosarcoma. Further management of the lung metastasis of leiomyosarcoma and possible radiation therapy are needed. Some authors suggest that multimodal therapy (surgical resection, radiation treatment, and chemotherapy) may result in reasonable survival improvement for patients. Isambert et al reported a mean survival of 18.2 months after incomplete resection and 11.2 months in nonresected patients. In our case, the patient received palliative treatment after surgery and died of tumor-related cardiopulmonary failure 6 months later.

At the first visit to the physician, because he could not describe any symptoms, only knee radiography was performed and there were no abnormalities. The pain in his right leg progressively worsened and he presented to our outpatient clinic after one month.\nOn physical examination, the patient was slightly obese with a height of 161 cm and weight of 63 kg noted. His right leg was externally rotated, and he hesitated to stand up. The passive range of motion of the right hip was limited, especially in adduction and internal rotation (right/left; flexion 90\u00b0/120\u00b0, extension 10\u00b0/10\u00b0, abduction 45\u00b0/45\u00b0, adduction 0\u00b0/30\u00b0, external rotation 60\u00b0/45\u00b0, and internal rotation 10\u00b0/30\u00b0).

At a certain moment, she felt the drooping shoulder with a popping sound. She was born via spontaneous full-term vaginal delivery with a normal APGAR score. She had no specific family history of nerve or muscle diseases. Her growth and developmental history was nonspecific before the onset of winged scapula. Upon the physical examination, a winging deformity of the right scapula was noticed with the lateral deviation and upward rotation of the inferior angle, as observed on the erect neutral posture (). This abnormality was not detected when both shoulders were abducted (), but it was aggravated by shoulder flexion (). The motor and sensory functions of the upper extremities were normal and no side to side differences were revealed. The deep tendon reflexes of the biceps and triceps muscles were normoactive and symmetrical. No significant muscle atrophy in the shoulder girdles and the upper extremities was observed. On the laboratory tests, the routine complete blood count with differential counting, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, rheumatoid arthritis factor and urinalysis were normal, and the muscle enzyme tests, including serum creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and transaminase, were also normal. Simple radiological studies, including the chest posterior-anterior view, both the shoulder anterior-posterior views and the scapular view, were nonspecific except for the slight scapular asymmetry.\nWe examined the nerves by conducting an electrodiagnostic examination that included the long thoracic nerve, the dorsal scapular nerve and the spinal accessory nerves and the muscles including serratus anterior, levator scapula, trapezius and rhomboideus and so on; there were no definitive evidences that indicated any neuropathy or myopathy on electrodiagnosis.\nWhen the pain and functional impairment persisted, surgical intervention then became appropriate.

She had perceived her recurrent shoulder dislocation from childhood. She complained of shoulder pain and restriction of activity in daily life (ADL) during shoulder movement due to shoulder instability. There was no abnormal finding from radiological examination. There were no psychiatric diseases. She could dislocate her bilateral shoulder joint voluntarily. Her chief complaint was the bilateral shoulder discomfort and instability during writing motion. On her first examination by a doctor, she was treated conservatively, using the exercise program for 6 months []. On her second examination by a doctor at another hospital, she was also treated conservatively, adding an orthosis for MDI to the exercise program (intervention A) []. The patient received an explanation about this report and provided informed consent that complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.\nThe patient had a slight build with a height of 156 cm and weight of 44 kg. To evaluate her bilateral shoulder function, her active range of motion (ROM) (), sulcus sign, and shoulder instability in each direction were measured on the time point at the beginning of intervention A. Her passive ROM was not able to be measured because her humeral head was dislocated so easily with passive ROM exercise. Muscle strength was also difficult to measure due to dislocation with ease. Although her humeral head dislocated many times during rehabilitation, the doctor allowed her rehabilitation because there was no increase of persistent pain and she could centralize her humeral head voluntarily. The modified Rowe score was measured to evaluate shoulder instability [] ().\nEDS patients usually suffer from many musculoskeletal symptoms, even when they grow up []. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that patients who have shoulder MDI will recover shoulder function during movement after rehabilitation programs [, ]. However, the prognosis of this patient was challenging because patients with EDS were excluded from the rehabilitation programs.\nThe AB design includes some measurement of outcome variables throughout a baseline control/comparison phase A and then throughout another intervention phase B []. In the early part of rehabilitation, the patient was provided with an exercise program for MDI with orthosis [] (intervention A). The term was continued for 3 months. In summary, she performed shoulder isometric muscle exercises using the TheraBand (Hygenic, Akron, Ohio) for the rotator muscles and scapula stabilizers with supervision by a physical therapist. The program includes five exercises: resistance exercises of shoulder abduction, internal rotation, external rotation, extension, and flexion. Assistance from a physical therapist to stabilize the humeral head was often needed so as not to dislocate it. The resistance during exercise was gradually increased according to her performance regarding shoulder dislocation. A physical therapy session was provided one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. Compliance of home exercises was no more than about twice a week.\nIn the latter part of rehabilitation, the patient was instructed to perform the Watson program for MDI [, , ] (intervention B). The Watson program is an exercise program that aims for coordination of scapular muscles with strengthening rotator cuff and deltoid muscle. This phase also lasted for 3 months. In summary, this program consists of six stages that focus on retraining specific scapular control before any deltoid and rotator cuff exercise. The patient should make progress with exercise into functional and sport-specific ranges. She also received a physical therapy session one to two times a week. Each session was 40 minutes. In the first stage, correction of her humeral head by a physical therapist was effective during shoulder movement. The scapular control exercise was performed with assistance. She could make progress to stage 2 within 1 month. She could finally perform stage 5 exercises after 2 more months of rehabilitation. Compliance of home exercises was more than 3 days a week.\nThe intervention was performed from July 2017 to January 2018. The patient was followed up until July 2018. The active ROM increased, while the passive ROM was not increased, due to easy dislocation (). The sulcus sign was still positive after intervention and at the time point of the final evaluation. The shoulder instability score was improved after intervention B (). She felt no pain and discomfort during writing motion after the time point. She could also control both humeral heads within proper position during ADL. A fair outcome was achieved by the final evaluation.", "Question": "What is the patient's body mass mass index (BMI)?

However, the leading symptom on presentation was watery diarrhea for 3 weeks.\nThe patient was accompanied by his father who reported that his son suffered from cachexia starting age 17. Prior to age 17, his medical history was unremarkable. His parents and 7 siblings are all healthy.\nAt the time of initial symptom onset, the patent lived in the Simanjiro district for cattle herding, while the rest of his family members lived in the suburban area of Arusha. He reported several insect bites during his period of working as a cattle herder. His symptoms gradually worsened with increasing weight loss and splenomegaly and as well as skin rashes and maculae in his face. After a year, he sought treatment from traditional healers. After another year of no improvement from consultation of the traditional healer, he presented to an outside hospital in the Arusha region (unknown diagnostic and treatment approach). Eventually, he was admitted at KCMC for further diagnostics.\nOn admission to KCMC, the patient\u2019s primary complaints were abdominal pain and swelling. The laboratory tests on admission revealed white blood count of 1.51 \u00d7 109/L (neutrophils 37.3%, lymphocytes 58.4%, monocytes 3.7%, eosinophils 0.4%, and basophils 0.2%), red blood cell count 2.21 \u00d7 1012/L, hemoglobin 4.9 g/dL, thrombocytes 56 \u00d7 109/L, creatinine 41 \u03bcmol/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 12.9 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 7.6 U/L, sodium 124.6 mmol/L, potassium 2.9 mmol/L, and chloride 106 mmol/L.

The sputum polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for tuberculosis (GenXpert, Cepheid, Sunnyvale, California, United States of America) was negative; a chest X-ray investigation was normal; and ultrasound of the abdomen revealed hepatosplenomegaly.\nOn physical exam, he appeared pale and was wasted with a body weight of 39 kg and a height of 172 cm. On abdominal exam, his spleen was enlarged 18 cm below costal margin; the liver was enlarged 3 cm below costal margin; there were traditional healer marks throughout the abdomen; there were no palpable lymph nodes; and the lungs and heart were normal. His skin exam demonstrated hypopigmented maculae scattered on his face with accentuation in the perioral region () and skin-colored maculae on his trunk and arms. The latter occurred a few months before presentation in the hospital. Alopecia areata was also noted.\nHis travel history includes a 3-month stay in Mombasa (Kenya), approximately 1 year prior to presentation, where he worked as a merchant. Travels to other areas in Kenya or other countries, especially to endemic VL areas, has been denied by the patient as well as travels within Tanzania.\nDue to pancytopenia, the patient was referred to the Hematology section of the Cancer Care Centre at KCMC, where we performed bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, revealing Leishmania amastigotes in macrophages (Figs and ). The rapid test for Leishmania antibody detection (IT LEISH) from the peripheral blood and the bone marrow aspirate remained negative.\nAfter discussion with senior experts in tropical diseases, we decided to reperform bone marrow aspiration for PCR in a reference laboratory, which found the aspirate positive for Leishmania species DNA.\nDue to the unavailability of liposomal Amphotericin, we initiated treatment with Amphotericin B (1 mg/kg IV).

He was treated with an intravenous saline infusion, subcutaneous calcitonin, and intravenous glucocorticoids, followed by intravenous bisphosphonates. Due to his persistent hypercalcemia he was subsequently given 120 mg denosumab (Prolia). During hospitalization, there was significant improvement in his mental status concurrently with the normalization of his calcium level, which was 9.44 mg/dl at discharge.\nHis past history was remarkable for his 2016 diagnosis of Rai stage IV chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The fluorescence in situ hybridization reaction revealed the deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del (17p)) in 20% of B-cell lymphocytes. In addition, in a bone marrow biopsy, the patient was found to have unmutated IGHV gene status and ZAP 70 expression in leukemia cells.\nIn 09/2017 he was admitted to the Department of Internal Medicine because of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Treatment with a high dose glucocorticoid was started, followed by a slow tapering down of the dose. In 12/2017 he was again admitted to the Department of Internal Medicine with left hemiparesis, dysarthria, and left facial nerve palsy. Complete right carotid occlusion was found in the CT angiography.\nAfter discharge, he was treated with 2 courses of a Rituximab + Bendamustine protocol with a significant decrease in lymphocytes counts. In September 2018 treatment with the second line agent Ibrutinib was started. One month later, he developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm. Six days before the present admission, the patient was hospitalized because of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with no evidence of myocardial ischemia. Ibrutinib was stopped because it was presumed to be the cause of the arrhythmia. During his present hospitalization additional laboratory tests revealed an elevated LDH level of 2250 U/l (reference range: 230\u2013480), an alkaline phosphatase level of 220 U/l (reference range: 30\u2013120), and low levels of PTH: 4.8 pg/ml (reference range: 18.4\u201381), 25 hydroxyvitamin D level of 52 mmol/l (reference range: 75\u2013220) with normal 1.25 dihydroxyvitamin D level of 61.3 nmol/l (reference range: 50\u2013190), WBC 108.000 (reference range: 4.5\u201311.5 K/\u03bcl), Lymphocytes 57%, PLT count of 88.000 (reference range: 150\u2013450 K/\u03bcl).\nIn the setting of his elevated LDH level, further decrease in his PLT level to 45.000 and severe hypercalcemia, it was decided to perform a positron emission tomography/computed tomography to assess the possibility of Richter transformation. The scan revealed a 1.3 cm nodule with an intensive uptake of tracer in the upper left lobe of the lung and in vertebra D 7, suspicious of metastasis (Fig. ).\nHe underwent a bronchoscopy with a transbronchial biopsy of the lesion. Non-small cell carcinoma displaying positive CK 7 and negative to TTF-1, napsin-A, and p 40 immunostaining was diagnosed. An epidermal growth factor genotype was negative for mutations. Immunohistochemical analysis was negative for ALK and ROS1 protein rearrangement as well as PDL1 expression. He underwent 1 course of chemotherapy in September 2019 that included carboplatin, paclitaxel, and pembroluzumab. Results of the molecular analysis of the tumor were negative for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) genotype mutations, ALK and ROS 1 rearrangement, and PDL-1 protein expression. He then began treatment with venetoclax for his refractory CLL.\nTen days after starting therapy with venetoclax, he was admitted to the internal medicine department with large left upper lobe pneumonia. A chest CT revealed a large infiltrate with an air bronchogram. A subsequent urine antigen test was positive for legionella pneumonia.

Thus, right sided continuous erector spinae block along was planned in combination with general anaesthesia.\nPreoperative antibiotic prophylaxis was administered with injection cefuroxime 1.5 g intravenous (IV). Under ultrasound guidance, a continuous erector spinae block was performed at L3 level. After explaining the procedure, consent was taken from the patient. She was placed in left lateral position for right sided block since we found it ergonomically easy to hold the ultrasound probe (high frequency linear probe) with left hand and place it transversely. An 18-guage tuohy needle was approached in-plane lateral to medial. When the needle initially touched the transverse process of L3 vertebrae, the needle was gently withdrawn and hydrodissection of the plane was achieved, lifting the erector spinae muscle. A 20-guage catheter was introduced through the needle and total length inserted was 3 cm more than the tip of needle. The catheter was secured properly for perioperative use.

She reported that the rash developed over a period of 3 months with an intermittent response to prednisone therapy. Three weeks prior to presentation, the rash became progressively worse. She developed fevers came on one week prior to presentation. The rash started on her arms and progressively spread. She admitted associated shortness of breath accompanied by a productive cough with green, bloody sputum, as well as nausea and vomiting. Patient reported compliance with her home dose of prednisone but may have not taken her mycophenolate mofetil regularly. She missed two sequential hemodialysis sessions due to pain with walking from the blistering rash on her soles of the feet.\nHer physical exam was significant for fever of 100.6\u00b0F and tachycardia with heart rate of 130 beats per minute. Skin exam was evident for brown plaques on the forehead and bilateral cheeks with sparing of the nasolabial folds, with erosions and hemorrhagic crust involving the philtrum, ears, forehead, nose, chin, and lips. There were dark brown plaques with few erosions and atrophic scars on bilateral forearms and lower legs with deep red to violaceous painful targetoid lesions on the palms and plantar surfaces (Figures and ). The skin over the trunk had pink eroded macules, and there were pink patches on the back within a background of dusky necrotic plaques. There were multiple full-thickness epidermal necroses with large areas of bleeding with the denuded skin on the arms and chest in the sun exposed distribution (). Oral mucosae were negative for any oral lesions.\nPatient was found to be pancytopenic with white blood cell count (WBC) 2.03 (Ref: 3.4\u201310.8 \u00d7 103/UL), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.25 (Ref: 1.4\u20137.0 \u00d7 103/UL), hemoglobin (Hb) 8.8 g/dL (Ref: 11.1\u201315.9 g/dL), hematocrit (Hct) 28.9% (Ref: 34\u201346%), platelet 69 (150\u2013450 \u00d7 103/UL), sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 98 mmol/L, CO2 21 mmol/L, BUN 41 mg/dL (Ref: 6\u201320 mg/dL), Cr 5.49 mg/dL (Ref: 0.57\u20131.0 mg/dL), calcium 7.2 mg/dL (8.7\u201310.2 mg/dL), albumin 3.2 g/dL, phosphorous 5.0 mg/dL (Ref: 1.2\u20132.2 mg/dL), AST 286 IU/L (Ref 0\u201340 IU/L), ALT 31 IU/L (0\u201332 IU/L), total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 136 IU/L, CK 91 U/L, serum lactate was 0.80 mmol/L, and ferritin was 5885 ng/mL (Ref: 15\u201350 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray did not show any lung infiltrates or effusions. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not show an acute abdominal process, and the liver demonstrated normal echogenicity, echotexture, and size; the spleen was not enlarged. Sputum gram stain and cultures were unremarkable. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and yeast. Patient was anuric due to chronic dialysis. Evaluation of lupus activity showed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody 42 IU/mL (Ref: 0\u20139 IU/L). Complement 3 (C3) was 43 mg/dL (Ref: 90\u2013180 mg/dL) and complement 4 (C4) was 9 mg/dL (Ref: 10\u201340 mg/dL). Rheumatoid factor was negative.

Skin biopsies showed focal interface changes, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for fungal microorganisms. Gram stain highlighted surface cocci bacteria. VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus.\nGiven her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven\u2013Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3\u2013858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome.\nDue to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases.\nIt was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations.

The patient also had edema of the lower extremities and mild respiratory distress.\nInitial laboratory findings including complete blood count (hemoglobin: 14.6 g/dl, white blood count: 22,800 /l, platelet count: 330,000/l), electrolytes and renal function tests were within normal range. Alanine aminotransferase level (19 U/l, N: <45 U/l) was normal. However aspartate aminotransferase (85 U/l, N: <41 U/l), gamma glutamyl transferase (238 U/l, N: 8-61 U/l) and total/direct bilirubin levels (3/1.6 mg/dl, N: <1.1/<0.3 mg/dl) were high. Serological evaluation for toxoplasma gondii, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, Epstein\u2013Barr virus and parvovirus were all negative. Abdominal ultrasonography (USG) revealed hepatomegaly with a heterogeneous liver parenchyma and a 39x31 mm hypo-echoic solitary non-calcified mass in the right adrenal region. A computed tomography scan revealed a right adrenal soft tissue mass (4.8x3.6 cm) with no calcification and contrast uptake, and significant hepatomegaly. The spleen appeared to be in normal size but was replaced inferiorly because of the massive hepatomegaly. Serum neuron-specific enolase level was higher, 60 ng/mL (normal range: <10 ng/mL), and alpha feto protein level (22754 ng/mL, N: >45000 ng/mL at birth) was normal. Urine vanillylmandelic acid and serum ferritin levels were 5718 mg/day (N: 0.5-2 mg/day) and 531 ng/mL (N: 24-336 ng/mL) retrospectively. Bone marrow aspiration revealed no malignant infiltration, no rosette forming and no storage cells. On the postnatal day eighteen, doppler USG showed decreased flow in the IVC, secondary to compression. Based on clinical presentation and imaging modalities, the presumptive diagnosis of NBL was made and the case was referred to our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) on the postnatal day twenty.\nOn admission to our NICU, he had respiratory distress with 40% O2 requirement and significant abdominal distension with visible thin venous vessels through his abdominal skin (Fig. 1a). He had tachypnea besides edema of lower extremities, scrotum and penile area. Complete blood count revealed anemia (hemoglobin: 9.5 g/dl), leukocytosis (33.300 /l) and mild thrombocytosis (536.000/l). Serum sodium (128 mEq/l), chloride (94 mEq/l), calcium (7 mg/dl) and phosphorus (0.7 mg/dl) concentrations were low. Serum uric acid and renal function tests revealed normal results (uric acid: 5.8 mg/dl, blood urea nitrogen: 9 mg/dl, creatinine: 0.43 mg/dl). Liver function tests revealed cholestasis (alanine aminotransferase: 40 U/l, aspartate aminotransferase: 101 U/l, \u03b3-glutamyltransferase: 463 U/l, total/direct bilirubin: 3.05/2.02 mg/dl) and hypoproteinemia (total protein: 3.4 g/dl and albumin: 1.8 g/dl). Clotting studies demonstrated prolonged prothrombin time (PT) as 16 seconds (N: 9.4 to 12.5 seconds) and low fibrinogen level (0.89 g/dl, N: 2.38\u20134.98).\nSecond abdominal USG evaluation showed right suprarenal mass which was about 5 cm in diameter, severely diffuse hepatomegaly and ascites. After pediatric oncology consultation, the patient underwent hydration, chemotherapy and allopurinol treatments between the postnatal days 20\u201323. The patient received modified VEC (vincristine, etoposide, carboplatin) protocol due to poor clinical condition. In spite of the received chemotherapy, his clinical condition worsened progressively. The abdominal distention was so increased that he required high frequency oscillatory ventilation support. However, he did not develop signs of tumor lysis syndrome. The patient was accepted as chemotherapy-resistant NBL due to clinical deterioration with massive liver involvement on the 3rd day of treatment and surgical excision was performed (Fig. 1b, 1c). Pathology revealed intra-adrenal tumor with wide-spread expression of bcl 2 in addition to distant metastases in the liver and minimal lymphocytic infiltration. MYC-N amplification obtained from adrenal specimen revealed <3 copies. IVC compression directly observed during the surgery resulted in severe circulation collapse and the patient died due to hypotensive shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation just two hours after the operation.", "Question": "Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

The pain affected her walking such that she was \u201cwaddling\u201d to avoid the pain. On occasions the pain would radiate to the right leg as well as anterior and lateral thigh but not past the knee. There were no associated paresthesias or significant weakness. She denied history of cancer, weight loss, fever, chills, or night sweats. There was no history of nephrolithiasis or bone fractures. She was being treated for diabetes and hypertension. She had history of pulmonary emboli of unclear etiology in the 1990 s. Surgical history included cholecystectomy in 1994, uterine endometrial ablation in 1996, and bilateral carpal tunnel surgeries. She had an allergy to penicillin causing a rash and an intolerance to sulfa causing abdominal discomfort. The patient reported remote history of smoking for 15 years, quitting 25 years ago. Family history was negative for bone disease. Physical exam was remarkable for her being overweight. She had a side-to-side waddle in her gait and slightly lifted her feet on walking. Straight leg raising test was negative. She did not have tenderness to percussion of the lower back but did have a gibbous at L-4. There was no back pain with movement. She had weakness at the iliopsoas and quadriceps bilaterally but no loss of sensation. An outside MRI of the lumbar spine showed an infiltrative lesion in the L-4 vertebra with collapse of the body (confirmed on repeat MRI at our institution, ). CT scan confirmed a pathologic fracture of L-4 with a lytic lesion. A bone scan showed mildly increased radiotracer uptake at L-4, and additional uptake was seen in several lower thoracic ribs bilaterally, as well as the xiphoid process, upper right femur, and skull, suggesting metabolic bone disease. The L-4 lesion was hypermetabolic on PET scan (). Initial CT guided biopsy of the lesion was nondiagnostic demonstrating only bone, fibrous tissue, and cartilage. Laboratory testing was remarkable for low serum phosphorus of 1.5 mg/dL (2.5\u20134.5 mg/dL). Additional abnormalities included elevated serum calcium of 10.6 mg/dL (8.9\u201310.1 mg/dL), inappropriately high parathyroid hormone (PTH) of 120 pg/mL (15\u201365 pg/mL), low 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D of <8 pg/mL (18\u201378 pg/mL), and mildly elevated serum alkaline phosphatase of 162 u/L (45\u2013115 u/L). Serum albumin was normal at 4.0 g/dL (3.5\u20135.0 g/dL), serum creatinine was 1.2 mg/dL (0.6\u20131.1 mg/dL), and 25-hydroxyvitamin D was normal at 31 ng/mL (25\u201380 ng/mL). She had frank phosphaturia, especially for her level of serum phosphorus (772 mg, normal 0\u20131,099 mg). 24-hour urine calcium was low at 10 mg (20\u2013275 mg). Serum and urinary protein electrophoresis with immunofixation were normal. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was normal at 2.12 mIU/L (0.3\u20135.0 mIU/L). Parathyroid scan was normal. Plasma FGF-23 from a peripheral vein was significantly elevated at 3,500 RU/mL (<180 RU/mL), confirming TIO. Oral phosphate supplementation and calcitriol were prescribed. She was subsequently lost to followup from our medical center for two years, and when she returned, she reported that she had internal fixation with a rod placement for a spontaneous right femur fracture. She also had deep pain in her left thigh and was told by a local provider that she had a \u201cbrown tumor\u201d in the left femur based on plain radiographs. She had not been taking phosphate supplements or calcitriol on a regular basis. Repeat laboratory investigations continued to show a significantly low phosphorus of 1.4 mg/dL (2.5\u20134.5 mg/dL), high serum calcium of 10.6 mg/dL (8.9\u201310.1 mg/dL), elevated PTH of 229.1 pg/mL (10\u201365 pg/mL), and serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL (0.6\u20131.1 mg/dL). Plasma FGF-23 level remained significantly elevated at 4,460 RU/mL (<180 RU/mL). A repeat CT guided needle biopsy of L-4 showed a low grade spindle cell neoplasm with positive FGF-23 mRNA expression by RT-PCR (), confirming the diagnosis of mixed phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor (PMT). She suffered a spontaneous left peritrochanteric fracture requiring placement of an intramedullary device. The patient then elected to have surgery involving anterior resection of the L-4 vertebral body to complete total spondylectomy at this spinal level, along with corpectomy. Pathology of the resection specimen confirmed a spindle cell neoplasm consistent with PMTMCT. Six months after surgical resection, she was independent in activities of daily living but was using a walker for ambulation due to some difficulty walking and right foot drop. She was prescribed physical therapy. Follow-up laboratory testing revealed normal serum phosphorus at 2.5 mg/dL (2.5\u20134.5 mg/dL) and calcium of 9.6 mg/dL (8.9\u201310.1 mg/dL). PTH was 619 pg/mL (10\u201365 pg/mL). This is on minimal phosphate supplementation without calcitriol.

He had no respiratory, neurological, rheumatological, ophthalmologic, or dermatological symptoms. Physical examination showed a pale child with weight and height both below the 3rd percentile for age. Laboratory investigations were remarkable for anemia (hemoglobin 9.8 g/dL), ESR 114 mm/h, serum calcium 2.26 mmol/L, and low albumin level 28 g/L. Endoscopy revealed an erosive, friable, and nodular gastric mucosa over the entire stomach. Histopathology of biopsies revealed chronic noncaseating granulomatous inflammation []. Special stains and cultures for acid-fast and fungal microorganisms showed negative results. Colonoscopy was normal including terminal ileum. CT scan of the chest and abdomen demonstrated multiple, small, centrolobularly distributed nodules within the acini of both lungs and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. Ophthalmological examination showed evidence of uveitis. ACE level was elevated at 135 U/L. Similar to Case 1, extensive investigations for infectious, immunologic, and inflammatory conditions associated with GIT granulomatous inflammation were negative.\nThe combination of tissue findings of granulomatous disease from upper GIT, elevated ACE, systemic involvement, and negative workup for infectious disease suggested systemic sarcoidosis with significant GI involvement. The patient received corticosteroids at 1 mg/kg/day and omeprazole, resulting in resolution of GI symptoms and normalization of activity markers and ACE level. Tapering of corticosteroids over 3 months led to relapse of the disease. Again, remission was induced by a course of steroids supplemented by mesalamine (Pentasa 50 mg/kg/day) and azathioprine (up to 2.5 mg/kg/day) to maintain remission. Throughout the 4-year follow up, the course of the disease was punctuated by several relapses on tapering of corticosteroids and later development of vitamin B12 deficiency anemia: hemoglobin 10.6 gm/dL, macrocytosis (MCV 102, normal 80\u201391 fL), hyperchromasia (MCH 34.5, normal 20\u201331 pg), low serum vitamin B12 119.2 pmol/L (normal 162\u2013638 pmol/L). Red blood cell folate level was normal at 16.2 nmol/L (normal, 10.4\u201342.2 nmol/L). Antigastric parietal cell antibodies were negative. The patient received weekly injections of vitamin B12 ( 1 mg weekly) for 6 weeks that raised the level to 231.8 pmol/L with correction of anemia and normalization of his peripheral blood picture.\nConsidering the steroid dependency of the disease and the short stature of the patient, he was commenced on infliximab 5 mg/kg administered intravenously at 0, 2 and 6 weeks and then every 8 weeks. The patient reported a significant subjective general improvement as well as resolution of his GI symptoms. ESR and ACE concentration returned to normal. A repeat of endoscopy after the 6th dose of infliximab infusion demonstrated loss of gastric folds pattern and loss of normal vascular pattern; otherwise there were no more erosions or friability.

Type 2 DM was diagnosed when he was 31 years old and initially treated with oral antihyperglycemic agents. The patient discontinued oral antidiabetic agents and started insulin therapy 4 years before admission. At that time, he was treated with long-acting insulin glargine and insulin aspart. This insulin regimen was switched to insulin degludec/liraglutide 3 months before admission. While he was on insulin degludec/liraglutide, his home blood glucose monitoring ranged from 110 to 70 mg/dL. Five days before admission, while on insulin degludec/liraglutide in a dose of 18 IU daily, the patient started having recurrent episodes of diaphoresis. During those episodes, usually in the early morning before breakfast, his blood glucose levels were below 50 mg/dL. The patient suffered from several further episodes despite insulin dosage tapering and even after discontinuation. His past medical history was notable for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, acute coronary syndrome, and osteomyelitis of the left foot. His family medical history included atrial fibrillation and DM. In addition to insulin, his therapy consisted in acetylsalicylic acid, bisoprolol, furosemide, ramipril, and atorvastatin. He denied oral antihyperglycemic agents. He had no known drug allergies, he was a former smoker, and he did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs.\nOn admission, the patient's blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg, heart rate was 71 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 98%, while he was breathing ambient air. The patient's body mass index was 26.7 kg/m2 (height: 173 cm; weight: 80 kg), and the physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory data on admission showed glucose 50 mg/dl, HbA1c 50 mmol/mol, normocytic anemia (hemoglobin 11.9 g/dL, hematocrit 34.8%, and mean corpuscular volume 85 fl), a normal white cell and platelet count, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 87 IU/L (normal range: 17\u201359), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 62 IU/l (normal range: 21\u201372), gamma glutamyl-transferase 545 IU/l (normal range: 15\u201373), alkaline phosphatase 177 IU/l (normal range: 38\u2013126), total bilirubin 0.47 mg/dL (normal range: 0.20\u20131.30), lactate dehydrogenase 1021 IU/L (normal range: 313\u2013618), albumin 3.5 g/dL (normal range: 3.6\u20135.5), INR 1.18, C-reactive protein 7.5 mg/dl (normal range: 0-1), erythrocyte sedimentation rate 90 mm/h (normal range: 0\u201315), fibrinogen 621 mg/dl (normal range: 170\u2013410), iron 37 \u03bcg/dl (normal range: 49\u2013181), and ferritin 776 ng/ml (normal range: 20\u2013325). Viral markers for hepatitis B and C were negative.\nFurther blood tests were ordered to rule out endogenous hyperinsulinism: C-peptide was 4.2 ng/mL (normal range: 0.5\u20133), insulin 89 \u03bcIU/mL (normal range: 5\u201325), while the patient's glucose level was 40 mg/dL, and sulfonylurea screening test was negative, confirming endogenous hyperinsulinism. Markers of neuroendocrine tumors were severely increased: chromogranin A (CgA) was 1790 ng/ml (normal range: 0\u2013100), and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) was 458 ng/ml (normal range: 0\u201311).\nGiven the high suspicion of insulinoma and the altered liver function tests on admission, a full-body CT scan was ordered. CT scan showed a 4.3 \u00d7 2.2 cm pancreatic tail mass containing calcifications with multiple regional lymphadenopathies (). Multiple liver secondary lesions were found: the largest ones measuring 12 and 11 cm, respectively, in II-III and IVb-V segments. No lungs, bone, and brain metastases were detected. Additionally, a thyroid nodule of 2.6 cm was incidentally found. Hepatic metastases were highly suspected to be secondary to a malignant insulinoma, so ultrasound-guided percutaneous biopsies of the lesion in the II-III segments were performed (). Histological findings of four core biopsies consisted of hepatocytes infiltrated by a poorly differentiated and focally necrotic proliferating tissue of medium-sized atypical epithelial cells with solid growth pattern (). The cancer cells showed hyperchromatic nuclei with \u201csalt and pepper\u201d chromatin markedly Ki-67 positive, high mitotic index (10 figures \u00d7 10 HPF), and scant cytoplasm. Immunohistochemistry studies revealed the neuroendocrine nature and the partial insulin secreting activity of the lesion; CgA, synaptophysin, CD56, and CAM5.2 were diffusely positive; there was patchy (<5%) insulin expression. Ki-67 index was 40\u201350. These findings were consistent with the diagnosis of metastatic, poorly differentiated (G3), neuroendocrine carcinoma with morphology and immunophenotype favoring a pancreatic primary tumor. Thyroid ultrasound () showed a weakly hypoechoic solid nodule (2.8 \u00d7 3.2 \u00d7 1.3 cm) with a central cystic component and regular margins located in the isthmus and a markedly hypoechoic solid nodule (0.9 \u00d7 0.9 \u00d7 0.6 cm) adjacent to the lower pole of the left lobe. Calcifications and intranodular flow were absent in both nodules, and regional lymph nodes were not enlarged. The results of thyroid function tests were within normal limits (TSH 0.7 mUI/L, normal range: 0.46\u20134.68), as well as were parathormone (PTH) (80.1 pg/mL, normal range: 13.6\u201385.8), calcium (8.76 mg/dL, normal range: 8.4\u201310.2), and phosphorus (4.32 mg/dL, normal range: 2.5\u20134.5). Serum calcitonin was slightly raised (30 pg/mL, normal range: 0\u20136), but immunohistochemical staining of the liver lesions was negative for such markers.\nThe patient's hospital stay was characterized by different episodes of severe hypoglycemia (as low as 18 mg/dL) occurring especially at night and in the early morning, manifesting only with diaphoresis. During those episodes, the patient never lost consciousness or developed seizures and even never complained of confusion, amnesia, weakness, diplopia, blurred vision, palpitations, or hunger. In order to reduce the hypoglycemic events, we started a symptomatic treatment with diazoxide and IV infusion of 10% dextrose, while waiting for histopathological confirmation of the disease.

He had normal lactate and lipase level. His transaminases were mildly elevated. His calcium level was 15.2 mg/dl with albumin level of 3.5 gm/dl. His parathyroid hormone level (PTH) was appropriately suppressed []. He was managed by the emergency physician with aggressive normal saline hydration, intravenous pamidronate and hydrocortisone.\nEndocrinology service was consulted and impression of non-parathyroid hormone related hypercalcemia was suggested. His work-up showed bilateral hilar opacity on chest X-ray, which was confirmed by a computerized scan of the chest showing bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.

There was a history of animal contact but no raw milk ingestion. She had normal bowel habits with no jaundice, dysphagia or any other GI symptoms. She had no neurological, rheumatological, ophthalmologic, or dermatological symptoms. Physical examination revealed a pale girl, at 10th percentile for weight and height, and hepatosplenomegaly. The laboratory examination was remarkable for anemia (hemoglobin 7.9 g/dL), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 120 mm/h, and an alanine aminotransferase of 75 U/L (normal, 0-35 U/L), serum calcium 2.6 mmol/L, and low albumin level 31 g/L. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed hepatosplenomegaly and hypodense nonenhancing lesions throughout the liver (variable in size from a few millimeters to 3 centimeters), and multiple enlarged abdominal lymph nodes. Chest CT scan showed basal and peripheral nodular opacities. Tests for mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) including tuberculin skin test and serum QuantiFERON showed negative results. Liver biopsy showed noncaseating granulomas []. In light of the strong epidemiological exposure, antituberculous medications were initiated (combination of isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and refampicin). Despite compliance with treatment and proper dosing, the patient persisted to be febrile with further weight loss.\nThree months later, the patient presented with repeated episodes of hematemesis and epigastric pain. Upper endoscopy revealed an erosive, hemorrhagic, nodular gastric mucosa over the entire stomach []. Histopathology of biopsies revealed chronic noncaseating granulomatous inflammation and tests for MTB, and fungal infection on the gastric biopsies were negative. Tests for antibodies associated with inflammatory bowel disease (perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, antiouter membrane protein C, and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae IgA and IgG) showed negative results. Oxidative burst test for chronic granulomatous disease was negative. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level was 45 U/L (normal, 29-110 U/L).\nGiven the multisystem involvement with significant chest findings, tissue findings of granulomatous disease from the liver and upper GIT, together with exclusion of other causes of granulomatous inflammation, the patient was diagnosed with active disseminated sarcoidosis, and intravenous corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg/day) and omeprazole were started. Ten days after steroid therapy, a repeat of upper endoscopy showed dramatic improvement in the esophageal and gastric appearance [], and a colonoscopy showed no colonic involvement and normal terminal ileum. Biopsies from the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum showed dramatic reduction in the inflammation and disappearance of the granulomatous changes. The corticosteroids were tapered over 3 months.

The patient reached menarche at twelve years old and experienced dysmenorrhea for the first three days of menstruation with menorrhagia. Apart from her maternal grandmother having endometriosis, there was no significant family history including thrombophilia or thromboembolic events.

On local examination, she was found to have anal fissures.\nOn investigating, her peripheral smear revealed pancytopenia with a haemoglobin of 4 g%, total leucocyte count of 490/cu mm and a platelet count of 13000/cu mm. Her bone marrow biopsy was diagnostic of aplastic anaemia. An ophthalmological examination by fundoscopy and a B-scan ultrasonography (USG) was done and she was found to have bilateral vitreous haemorrhage and retinopathy.\nShe was transfused with multiple units of packed red cells and platelets. She was started on medroxy-progesterone acetate and tranexamic acid for menorrhagia along with iron and folate tablets. She was given cyclosporine for aplastic anaemia. In view of high fever spikes of 103 to 104 degrees F, she was started on empirical ceftazidime and amikacin. Her fever could not be localised and her initial blood and urine cultures were sterile. She had persistent fever and was switched over to meropenam and then to vancomycin.\nAfter one week her perianal pain worsened and she passed blood clots per rectum associated with pus discharge. Her anal canal was extremely tender. Computed tomography (CT) scan of her abdomen and pelvis showed features suggestive of perianal abscess with proctitis and sloughed out mucosa in the anal canal (Figure ).\nOn examination under anaesthesia, the following findings were noted: the entire anal canal from the anal verge to about 10 cm proximal appeared dark brown in colour with sloughed out mucosa, the sphincters appeared non-viable, the tone was lost, and there was no bleeding on cutting through the tissues. The anal canal was filled with foul-smelling necrotic tissues mixed with blood clots (Figure ).\nDebridement of the necrotic devitalised tissues was done and the pus collection was drained (Figure ). A diversion transverse colostomy was made. She was started on piperacillin-tazobactam and clindamycin.\nGram stain of necrotic tissues revealed gram-positive bacilli suggestive of Clostridium along with budding yeast cells. Her subsequent blood cultures grew Clostridium spp and then Escherichia coli (intermediate sensitivity to imipenam) and Acinetobacter baumanii (resistant to all). Her total leucocyte count dropped down to 270/cu mm with an absolute neutrophil count of 30/cu mm. Her general condition worsened. She developed acidosis with the deterioration of vitals.

At that point, she had a slightly enlarged liver with normal liver function tests and massive renal cysts. She reached ESRD requiring RRT in 2005 and received a deceased donor kidney transplant 2 years later. She developed progressive graft dysfunction due to chronic allograft nephropathy that required starting PD in August 2014. In November 2014, she was admitted to our hospital with a 3-week history of lower limb edema with painful skin ulcers, symptomatic hypotension and tachycardia (118 bpm), anorexia, nausea, and incoercible vomiting. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 70/45 mm Hg and ulcers with necrotic areas and cellulitis in the external distal third of both legs. Laboratory findings revealed severe malnutrition (serum albumin 1.5 g/dL) and elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein: 288 mg/L; procalcitonin: 1.9 \u03bcg/L). A Doppler ultrasound showed bilateral femoral vein thrombosis, and so pulmonary thromboembolism was ruled out and due to the extensive thrombosis, a complete hypercoagulability state check was done, but no abnormalities were detected and tumor markers were normal. An abdominal CT was then performed showing large liver and renal polycystic disease, both organs with giant cysts (>15 cm). A giant hepatic cyst producing an extrinsic compression of the intrahepatic inferior cava vein (ICV) and massive venous thrombosis from ICV to bilateral iliofemoral deep veins involving the kidney graft vein was observed. The CT also demonstrated displacement and extrinsic compression of the stomach, pylorus, and duodenum due to another enlarged liver cyst, shown in Figures and .\nAfter the CT findings, we considered the clinical presentation was consistent with an ICV syndrome due to ICV compression and thrombosis. Furthermore, vomiting and oral intake intolerance with severe malnutrition were caused by a complete pyloric and duodenal collapse by the enlarged liver cyst.\nAnticoagulation therapy was started, but vomiting with oral intolerance persisted and the patient remained dependent on parenteral nutrition. Thus, percutaneous drainage and alcohol sclerosis of the compressive liver cyst was decided, with successful return of the stomach to its normal location, shown in Figure . Nausea and vomiting resolved in a few days, and adequate oral intake was resumed. Severe hypotension and tachycardia gradually improved, and a repeated CT revealed complete stomach expansion, as shown in Figure . PD therapy was modified but not disrupted, and 1 year later, the patient remained asymptomatic.

She reported a weight loss of 15 pounds in the past year. She had been a smoker but had quit five years prior to the presentation. Prior to this hospital visit, she had consulted an outpatient clinic with complaints of fever, chills, and cough. She had received a flu vaccine a month prior. She had been thought to have a viral respiratory infection as an outpatient. Ibuprofen, and later azithromycin, had been prescribed, which had not alleviated her initial symptoms before the current presentation.\nOn physical exam, she had a temperature of 39.3 \u00b0C in the emergency department. She was tachycardic at 130 beats per minute and tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Her blood pressure was 149/74 mmHg. She had bilateral conjunctival injection, but her eyelids were grossly unremarkable. There was left axillary lymphadenopathy. A physical breast exam was normal with no palpable masses. There was no other palpable adenopathy, skin rashes, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, clubbing, or edema. The respiratory and cardiovascular exams were otherwise unremarkable. Her ECG showed sinus tachycardia at 106 beats per minute but was otherwise unremarkable.\nRelevant laboratory workup included a leukocytosis of 16.7 Thou/uL (normal range: 3.8-10.2) with a neutrophilic predominance of 82.9%. She had chronic anemia with a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 8.9 g/dl (11.9-15.1) and a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 76 fL (78.2-98.4). Her ferritin was more than 7,500 ng/ml (11-307), with a total iron-binding capacity of 204 (250-450), and a low iron level of 37 ug/dl (50-212). Her angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level was 97 U/l (8-52). Her C-reactive protein (CRP) was 19.05 mg/dl (0.02-1.00), D-dimer was 13.46 ugFEU/ml (<0.50), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 54 U/L (13-39), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 66 U/L (7-52); she had calcium of 9.0 mg/dl (8.6-10.2), albumin of 3.0 g/dl (3.5-5.0), corrected calcium of 9.8 mg/dl, serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D level of 22.4 ng/ml (30-100), creatinine of 1.11 mg/dl (0.49-1.01), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 344 U/L (140-271).\nThe patient had not undergone a prior mammogram. A CT angiography (CTA) was performed, which ruled out any pulmonary embolus. There was no evidence of a pulmonary embolus, or pulmonary nodules, or infiltrates. However, the CTA revealed right hilar lymphadenopathy of 1.3 cm in size and subcarinal lymphadenopathy of 1.1 cm (Figures , ).\nA CT of the abdomen revealed a cystic mass of the left retroperitoneum measuring 14 x 11 x 6 cm. The official radiology report suggested that it was of a benign etiology, which could include cystic lymphangioma, mesenteric cyst, or duplication cyst. A cystic neoplasm was considered unlikely in the radiology report. The patient was placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, and azithromycin as well as intravenous fluids to treat a possible unknown infective source while awaiting cultures and further investigation. It was initially thought that a respiratory or abdominal source was the possible infective foci, which guided the selection of antibiotics.\nThe infectious disease team suspected an intrabdominal or lung infective etiology. An initial differential by the infectious diseases specialists, aside from infection, also included lymphoma and autoimmune processes such as sarcoidosis. The pulmonology team later advised that there was no evidence of pneumonia or tracheobronchitis. The hematology team emphasized the need to rule out lymphoma. Blood cultures, sputum cultures, and urine cultures were all negative. Antibiotics were initially tapered to ceftriaxone and metronidazole and then completely discontinued on day six. Drainage of the abdominal cyst revealed 250 mL of pale straw-colored serous fluid. Fluid chemistries were negative for an infectious or malignant etiology.\nThe patient underwent extensive investigation. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, serum creatine kinase levels, serum HIV tests, rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test, an acute hepatitis panel, three acid-fast sputum stains, QuantiFERON\u00ae-TB Gold test, anti-SS-A antibody levels, anti-SS-B antibody levels, and urinalysis were all normal. She did, however, test positive for an antinuclear antibody (ANA) speckled+ pattern. The ANA titer was 1:320. The double-stranded DNA antibody levels were within the normal range at 49 Iu/ml (<200 Iu/ml). A bone marrow biopsy of the iliac crest showed no evidence of malignancy or acid-fast bacilli.\nSurgery was consulted for an excisional lymph node biopsy of the left axillary lymph node. The sample was a solid tan nodular-appearing tissue measuring 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. Biopsy revealed numerous non-caseating epithelioid granulomas present in the lymphoid tissue. Stains were negative for acid-fast bacilli and fungus. The biopsy results were consistent with sarcoidosis. Flow cytometry later showed no evidence of B or T cell lymphoma.\nA tentative diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made. The granulomatous disease is seen only in sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, or fungal infections. The non-caseating granulomatous disease in the lymph nodes pointed most closely to sarcoidosis. The pulmonologist considered this to be a case of extrapulmonary sarcoidosis because only hilar nodes were involved without any lung parenchymal involvement. It was thought conceivable that the ANA elevation may have been related to sarcoidosis, although we agreed to continue to monitor the patient for other collagen vascular diseases.\nDuring the hospitalization, the patient had daily high-grade fevers. The fevers were intermittent, daily, variable, and went from 38.4 to a high of 39.4 \u00b0C. The patient was also seen by ophthalmology, and she was diagnosed with blepharitis. No uveitis or episcleritis was noted. She was treated with eye drops containing steroids, antimicrobials, and artificial tears. She was started on prednisone 40 mg PO daily with outpatient follow-up. Her fever and ocular symptoms resolved.

On examination, she was pale and drowsy, but devoid of any focal motor deficit. Her blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg, pulse rate was 108/min, temperature was 36.8 degree Celsius, and random blood sugar level was 112 mg/dL. Two months prior to presenting to us, she started experiencing recurrent episodes of vague abdominal pain, which would last for several minutes to hours and resolve spontaneously. Two weeks earlier, she had a similar episode associated with acute urinary retention, for which she was treated with injection furosemide, injection amikacin, injection pantoprazole, and laxative elsewhere.\nEvaluation in our hospital revealed anemia with hemoglobin of 9.2 g%, total white blood count of 10,300 cells/cu.mm, differential count showing 85% polymorphs, 13% lymphocytes, 2% eosinophils, and platelet count of 3.12 lakh cells/cu.mm. Peripheral smear study revealed normochromic normocytic anemia. Urinalysis was unremarkable. Her blood urea was 17 mg/dL and serum creatinine-1.1 mg/dL. Serum electrolytes showed presence of hyponatremia (Sodium = 103 mEq/dL) and hypokalemia (Potassium = 3.0 mEq/dL). Her magnesium was 3.9 mg/dL and phosphorus was 4.1 mg/dL. Initial computed tomography imaging of the brain was unremarkable.\nShe was euvolemic, and in view of acute severe symptomatic hyponatremia and hypokalemia, she was treated with intravenous 3% saline and potassium infusion. She was also initiated on intravenous phenytoin at a loading dose of 15 mg/kg followed by maintenance dose of 100 mg thrice a day for seizures. After 3 days of treatment, she recovered without any neurological deficit and her sodium and potassium levels gradually became normal.\nTwo days later, she developed status epilepticus again. Her electrolytes revealed sodium of 111 mEq/dL and potassium of 2.3 mEq/dL. She was again initiated on intravenous 3% saline and potassium supplements. She recovered without any neurological deficit. Her repeat urinalysis was normal.\nMagnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity in the right frontal lobe and subcortical U-fibers, in which case, the differentials thought of were posterior reversible encephalopathy, extra pontine myelinolysis, and post-ictal changes. However, in the absence of an acute rise in blood pressure and renal failure, posterior reversible encephalopathy was unlikely.\nShe was clinically euvolemic. Hyponatremia evaluation revealed serum sodium of 111 mEq/dL, serum osmolality of 244 mOsm/kg, urine osmolality of 440 mOsm/kg, urine sodium of 88 mEq/dL, serum uric acid of 2.8 mg/dL, serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, serum cortisol of 15 mg/dL, and thyroid-stimulating hormone of 3.5 mIU/L. She was not on any diuretics. Hence, a diagnosis of syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) secretion was entertained. On evaluation, there was no evidence of any infection, organic neurological disorders, or malignancy. She was not on any antipsychotic therapy.\nDuring the hospital stay, she continued to have muscle cramps with severe spasmodic episodes of abdominal pain, which now subsided on treatment with opioids. Ultrasonogram of the abdomen revealed sludge in the gall bladder, normal-sized kidneys, normal pelvicalyceal system, and a normal urinary bladder. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed multiple tiny gall stones. Serum Amylase (275.9 U/L) and lipase (486.4 U/L) were elevated. During this episode of acute abdomen, her urine was noticed to have a reddish hue, which did not further change color on standing. Repeat urinalysis did not show any active sediments.\nFor the management of symptomatic gallstones, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was contemplated. Meanwhile, she again presented with acute abdominal pain and was treated with opioids. During this episode, her urine was noticed to be of port-wine color, which aroused a strong suspicion of porphyria. Hence we proceeded with the screening test for porphyria, i.e, the Watson Schwartz method which turned out to be positive [Figures and ] Also examination under ultraviolet lamp showed pink fluorescence at 410 nm. A 24-h urinary assay for porphobilinogen (PBG) and aminolevulinic acid (ALA) was done and they turned out to be normal, probably because it was done after the acute episode had subsided. However, with a strong suspicion of porphyria, analysis of the hydroxymethybilane synthase (HMBS) gene encoding HMBS was done using targeted next-generation sequencing. It revealed a heterozygous missense variant in exon 13 of the HMBS gene on chromosome 11 that resulted in the amino acid substitution of arginine for glycine at codon 280 (chr11:g. 118963657G>A; Depth of coverage: 60\u00d7) (p.Gly280Arg; ENST00000278715.3).

Her symptoms, which had developed over the last four months, consisted of unrelenting lower abdominal pain that began 30 minutes after eating and lasted for about three hours. It was unrelieved by bowel movements or changes in position. For this reason, the patient reduced her food intake, and her weight decreased by 5 kg. The day before admission, bloody diarrhea developed.\nThe patient had a history of arterial hypertension, hiatal hernia, bilateral hearing loss due to chronic otomastoiditis, and polyarthritis (cervical, dorsal, and lumbosacral spondylosis; bilateral osteoarthritis of the hip). She had undergone open surgical cholecystectomy for gallstones in 1959. In 1998, she was hospitalized for rectal bleeding caused by acute diverticulitis. In 2004, she was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the papilla of Vater and had a cephalic pancreaticoduodenectomy. The pathological examination revealed a moderately differentiated intestinal-type adenocarcinoma measuring 1.5 cm in diameter that had invaded the muscle layers of the duodenal wall. The margins were tumor-free, and two lymph nodes were negative for malignancy. During that hospitalization, she developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that was converted to a normal sinus rhythm with amiodarone. Her medications included zofenopril (7.5 mg/day), manidipine (10 mg/day), esomeprazole 20 mg/day, celecoxib (400-600 mg/day), and acetaminophen plus codeine (500 mg plus 30 mg/day). She had no known drug allergies.\nDuring admission, she was alert and oriented with normal vital signs (blood pressure, 150/70 mm Hg; heart rate, 80 beats per minute; temperature, 36.8\u00b0C). The lower abdomen was tender, but there were no signs of peritonitis. Although the bowel sounds were decreased, passage of flatus and feces was normal. There was no palpable organomegaly. The patient's lungs were clear on auscultation and a systolic ejection murmur (2/6) was heard over her aortic area. Admission laboratory tests revealed: hemoglobin 12.1 g/dl; white-cell count 15,290/mm3 (neutrophils 86%); platelet count 317,000/mm3; total protein 5.6 g/dl; albumin 3.2 g/dl. Serum electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, gamma glutamyl transferase, and amylase levels were within normal limits, as were the prothrombin and partial thromboplastin time. Plain films of the abdomen revealed no free intraperitoneal air or air-fluid levels, and the chest x-ray excluded the presence of pneumonia or nodules. Immediately after admission she was placed on an NPO (nil per os) regimen with total parenteral nutrition, and within eight hours her symptoms completely disappeared.\nAbdominal CT (Figure ) revealed a hypodense mass measuring 4 \u00d7 4 cm in the space between the vena cava and the aorta, at the level of the origin of the celiac trunk. The mass extended caudally for about 4 cm, enveloping the origin of the superior mesenteric artery, the left renal vein at its confluence into the inferior vena cava, and the origin of the right renal artery, and anteriorly to the confluence of the splenic and mesenteric veins. Enlarged lymph nodes (1 cm) were observed at the hepatic hilum and in the intercavoaortic and left para-aortic spaces. Thickened bowel loops were also seen. This picture was consistent with local recurrence of the neoplastic disease.\nA week later, oral feedings were resumed and the patient once again experienced diffuse abdominal pain and diarrhea. The pain responded poorly to conventional analgesics (scopolamine 20 mg IV, acetaminophen 500 mg PO, tramadol 37.5 mg PO t.i.d., fentanyl 25 \u03bcg transdermally), but it disappeared promptly when oral feedings were withdrawn.\nA duplex ultrasound examination was performed to assess the mesenteric circulation (Figure and Figure ). To the extent that it could be explored, the artery showed no evident stenoses on B-mode or color- and power-Doppler evaluation. The superior mesenteric artery was characterized by a high peak systolic velocity (283 cm/sec) that was consistent with vascular stenosis. Blood flow in the celiac artery was turbulent, and the peak systolic velocity was also high (118 cm/sec). The patient was started on subcutaneous enoxaparin (4000 U/day) and transdermal nitroglycerin (10 mg/day, from 08.00 to 20.00). Since oral feedings could not be resumed, a central venous catheter was inserted for prolonged parenteral nutrition.\nIn view of the tumor histotype and the age and general condition of the patient, there was no indication for systemic chemotherapy and the patient was transferred to a hospice.

On physical examination, she was only able to speak in two-word sentences. There were bilateral coarse crackles all over the chest. She did not have any focal neurological deficits. Cardiovascular examination did not reveal abnormal heart sounds. Abdominal examination was unremarkable. The patient was immediately placed on a nonrebreather mask. However, the patient kept taking off her nonrebreather mask, continued to have worsening hypoxia, and eventually required tracheal intubation. Chest radiograph showed right upper lobe pneumonia (Figure ).\nShe was started on vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam and levofloxacin, and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Broad spectrum antibiotic therapy was chosen due to patient's critical condition and unclear etiology of the infecting pathogen.

Urine drug screen was positive for cocaine, benzodiazepine, and opiates. Urine Legionella antigen and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen were negative. Influenza A was positive on rapid antigen testing and the patient was started on oseltamivir. This raised our concern for secondary bacterial pneumonia from MRSA as a complication of influenza virus infection. The patient had computed tomography (CT) of the chest that showed right upper, middle, and lower lobe consolidations with cystic destruction of the lung parenchyma (Figures , ).\nSputum culture and blood cultures grew MRSA that was sensitive to both vancomycin and clindamycin, confirming our diagnosis. Vancomycin had already been started on admission and was continued. Fluid resuscitation was also done early in the course, but eventually progressed to septic shock.

Contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans showed a multifocal decreased perfusion defect of the left kidney. Blood and urine culture samples were obtained, and intravenous ceftriaxone (2 g/d) was administered immediately. His fever subsided within 72 hours, and laboratory data demonstrated improvement. Five days after admission, the initial urine and blood cultures revealed growth of methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). Urologic evaluation regarding bladder obstruction and screening for metastatic infection were recommended. However, the patient declined further evaluation, as his discomfort had subsided, and his poor socioeconomic status impeded the payment of additional medical costs. Eight days after admission, laboratory data demonstrated further improvement (WBC count, 8,760/mm3; CRP level, 1.95 mg/dL). Follow-up urine and blood cultures obtained on day 5 revealed no bacterial growth. The patient was therefore discharged with oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg every 12 hours) for 7 days. He was asked to attend the outpatient clinic for 1 month to receive maintenance ciprofloxacin, but he failed to attend.\nApproximately 1 month later, the patient presented with a 7-day history of symptoms consistent with those at his initial visit. His vital signs were as follows: a blood pressure of 110/70 mm Hg, temperature of 38.4\u2103, heart rate of 115 beats/min, and respiration rate of 20 breaths/min. Bilateral costovertebral angle tenderness was noted. Laboratory data revealed a WBC count of 15,870/mm3, hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL, platelet count of 375,000/mm3, and CRP level of >12 mg/dL. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, alanine transaminase, and aspartate transaminase levels were within the normal range. Urinalysis showed a WBC count of 30\u201350/HPF with many bacteria and a red blood cell count of 5\u201310/HPF. A CT scan showed a multifocal decreased perfusion defect of both kidneys () with bladder distension. Urologic evaluation demonstrated a residual urine volume of 250 mL. Prostate-specific antigen levels were normal. He was therefore diagnosed with recurrent pyelonephritis and neurogenic bladder. An oral alpha blocking agent and intravenous ciprofloxacin (400 mg every 12 hours) were administered. Two days after readmission, his left lower flank pain persisted, despite a fentanyl patch (12 \u00b5g/h). Although there were no neurologic deficits, a neurosurgeon was consulted regarding his severe pain and the possibility of concomitant spinal disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium enhancement was performed, revealing epidural abscesses at L4\u20135 and paraspinal abscesses of the muscles at L3\u2013S2 (). Ultrasound-guided aspiration of the paraspinal muscle layer was performed using an 18-gauge needle, and approximately 10 mL of yellow-white mucoid fluid was aspirated. The epidural abscesses were not drained, as there were no neurologic deficits. Cultures of blood and drained fluid revealed MSSA growth () with antimicrobial sensitivity identical to that of the initial culture. Urine cultures revealed growth of <1,000 colony forming units/mL, although the bacterial strain could not be identified. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed no evidence of infective endocarditis. Nafcillin was injected every 4 hours for 22 days. However, neutropenia occurred, and nafcillin was replaced with vancomycin for an additional 30 days. On day 57 after readmission, MRI showed the abscesses had decreased in size (). Residual urine volume was 40 mL, and no discomfort was observed. Laboratory data were nearly within the normal range (WBC count, 6,490/mm3; CRP level, 0.35 mg/dL). On day 59, he was discharged without neurologic sequelae and was prescribed ciprofloxacin (500 mg every 12 hours) until a repeat MRI showed no remnant abscesses.", "Question": "What is the patient's score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?", "LLM Answer": "0", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "1.5", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The Well's score for pulmonary embolism is currently 0.\nClinical signs and symptoms of DVT are repoted to be absent and so the total score remains unchanged, keeping the total score at 0.

The x-ray showed a mediastinal mass overlapping the aortic arch region (Fig. ). For verification a computed tomography (CT) was performed and revealed incidentally a type B dissection, which was most likely chronic without information of the index date, originating from an aneurysm of a left cervical arch with a maximum diameter of 6 cm (Fig. ). The left renal artery, the coeliac trunc and the main part of the superior mesenteric artery branched from the false lumen without a sign of malperfusion of the organs. Because of the huge diameter and the potential risk of rupture, an urgent surgical repair was planned. Before intervention the patient got a blood pressure adjustment by ACE inhibitor. Betablocker was not necessary because of a resting pulse under 60 beats per minute. For neurological online monitoring, sensitive and motor evoked potentials were monitored. Spinal drainage was installed 1 day before the procedure. Surgical access was carried out through median sternotomy and an additional left lateral thoracic incision through the fourth intercostal space (Hemi-Clemshell). Simultaneously to the preparation of the aneurysm, partial cardiopulmonary bypass was installed in the left groin by cannulation of the femoral artery and vein under echocardiographic guidance. During selective ventilation of the right side, the left lung was mobilized by transsection of the Ligamentum pulmonale and preparation of the perianeurysmatic tissue and adhesions. After identification and preparation of the recurrent and phrenic nerve and the supraaortal branches, the descending aorta was clamped and a distal anastomosis performed with a straight graft (20 mm). The visceral arteries partially branched from the false and true lumen without a sign of malperfusion. Before the final distal anastomosis, we performed a fenestration of the dissection membrane about a length of 5 cm to keep the perfusion of both lumina. The left carotid artery originated from the aortic arch with a distance of only 1 cm from the aneurysm. The left axillary artery branched directly from the aneurysm and was dissected and reimplanted with a separate 8 mm sidegraft to the 20 mm straight graft between the distal arch and proximal descending aorta. (Fig. ). The procedure was performed with partial cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) of 87 min, aortic clamp time of 62 min under normothermic condition. The patient was extubated on first postoperative day and recovered well.\nBiopsy of aortic tissue showed a picture consistent with arteriosclerosis and loss of smooth muscle cells, rupture of the elastic fibres and fibrosis of the media. The intima could not be visualized in detail.\nThe patient was discharged to cardiac rehabilitation at 13th postoperative day and recovered well. Last follow up with computed tomography was performed 3, 5 years after initial operation with a good and stable result of the dissection membrane and a perfusion of both lumina.
