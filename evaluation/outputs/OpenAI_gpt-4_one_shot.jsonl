He had no surface lymphadenopathy. Laboratory findings included: white blood cell (WBC) count, 4.2 \u00d7 109/L; hemoglobin, 9.6 g/dL; platelet count, 106 \u00d7 109/L; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 1662 IU/L; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 6562 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 1407 IU/L; alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 509 IU/L; \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase (\u03b3-GTP), 130 IU/L; total bilirubin, 2.7 mg/dL; prothrombin time (PT), 20.3 s; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.73; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 34.4 mg/dL; and creatinine, 1.4 mg/dL. Serologic tests were all negative for hepatitis A, B, C, and E. Computed tomography (CT) performed at admission revealed no distinct nodules or masses in the liver, but mild splenomegaly, multiple hypodense splenic lesions, and para-aortic lymph node swelling (Fig. a\u2013c). Antibiotics were administered intravenously for suspected acute cholangitis and sepsis, but the fever persisted. Abdominal ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed 2 days later newly depicted gallbladder wall thickening and ascites (Figs. , ). On the same night, the patient presented with grade II hepatic encephalopathy, with blood tests showing a decrease in platelet count and worsening liver function suggestive of \u201cacute type\u201d ALF with hepatic coma and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). While consideration was being given to treating acute liver failure, the patient suddenly developed ventricular fibrillation and died despite immediate resuscitation measures on day 3 of hospitalization.\nGiven the rapid clinical course, an autopsy was performed in this patient with suspected ALF likely due to drug-induced liver injury, autoimmune hepatitis, hepatitis of indeterminate etiology, circulatory disturbance, metabolic disease, or malignant cells including malignant lymphoma. This led to the patient being diagnosed with malignant, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, characterized by multiple lymph-node, as well as multi-organ (i.e., spleen, liver, lung, and prostate) involvement: (1) general swelling of lymph nodes in the para-abdominal aorta (Fig. a), peripancreatic, peribronchial, pulmonary hilar, subclavicular regions, as well as in the pelvis, especially around the iliac arteries, measuring up to 60 mm in diameter; (2) presence of multiple whitish splenic nodules (Fig. b) with the entire spleen shown to be microscopically infiltrated by tumor cells (Fig. a); (3) irregular geographical morphology of the liver (Fig. c) with the lymphoma cells mainly infiltrating the portal areas (Fig. b); (4) involvement of the right lobe of the lung; (5) involvement of both lobes of the prostate consequent to outer connective tissue involvement (Fig. c). Microscopically, the tumor cells in the lymph nodes were shown to have medium-sized irregular nuclei and small nucleoli with a high nuclear cytoplasmic ratio, thus showing diffuse proliferation characterized by the presence of large numbers of small T-cells (Fig. ). Immunohistochemistry revealed the tumor cells to be positive for CD20 (Fig. a), CD79a (Fig. b), bcl-2 (Fig. c), and MUM1 (Fig. d), but negative for CD3 (Fig. e), CD10, bcl-6, and cyclin D1, with a Ki-67 labeling index (Ki-67 LI) of 16% (Fig. f).

The patient states he has had chest discomfort and food intolerance for the past week, but that his symptoms were far worse tonight. He notes no inciting event, recent trauma, or aggravating factors. On exam he appears uncomfortable, anxious, and is in a semi-tripod position. Vitals are pertinent for a heart rate of 144, systolic blood pressure in the 180 s, and oxygen saturation of 89% on 1L O2 via nasal cannula. Of note, the patient weighed 67.2 kg, and was 173 cm tall. Chart review showed that he had lost approximately 4 kg (last recorded weight in chart was 71.2 kg), since his last medical visit.\nPrimary survey was overall unremarkable. Airway was secure, patient\u2019s breathing improved with 3 L oxygen, breath sounds were present and equal bilaterally, vascular access was obtained, and GCS was 15. Intravenous pain medication was given which improved the patient\u2019s blood pressure to systolic 140 s. Given this patient\u2019s overall clinical picture, the most pressing disease processes included myocardial infarction (given history of coronary artery disease and prior infarcts), aortic dissection (given symptoms, hypertension, and medical history), pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism (the previous two diagnoses given his chest pain and decreased O2 even on 1 L of oxygen), and cardiac wall rupture (given multiple prior MIs). Other considerations include congestive heart failure, hypertensive crisis, and an underlying infection.\nLabs were drawn to include a CBC, renal panel, cardiac panel, lactate, and a type and cross. EKG was unremarkable. A chest X-ray was obtained which revealed a widened mediastinum (Fig. ).\nThe patient was stabilized, but the underlying cause of his symptoms had not yet been identified. His widened mediastinum is troubling, and further drives the differential. Aortic (dissection, aneurysm), cardiac (tamponade, wall rupture), and esophageal pathology (rupture versus other masses) now move to the top of the list of diagnoses. Labs continued to be pending. Given his now overall hemodynamically stable status and clinical improvement, the decision was made to obtain a CT chest/abdomen/pelvis which revealed the following (Fig. ).\nAlong with the CT scan; the initial set of labs resulted and were pertinent for leukocytosis (white blood cell count/WBC) of 19,000/mcL, creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, lactate of 3.94 mmol/L, and troponin of 0.101 ng/mL. Although no official read of the images were immediately available, a preliminary read by the team was concerning for mega-esophagus versus a strangulated hiatal hernia. Treatment of the pathology to limit the degree of heart strain (increased troponin), ischemia (as evidenced by the WBC and lactate), and possibility for future perforation were now the primary goals. Night Hawk radiology was contacted for an emergent read, who stated that the images were consistent with a severely dilated esophagus. No pulmonary emboli were visualized, and no other acute abnormalities were reported.\nThe findings, treatment modalities, risks, and benefits were discussed in depth with the patient. Given his dilated esophagus which was severe enough to cause him chest pain, dyspnea, alter his vitals, elevate his WBC, elevate lactate levels, and cause heart strain. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with possible video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), possible thoracotomy, possible laparoscopy, and possible laparotomy were recommended to the patient. The goal was for direct visualization of area, decompression, and repair of any defects. The patient was in full agreement with the plan, and was taken to the operating room shortly thereafter. In the mean time, given the location of the pathology and concern for developing septic picture, the patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and an antifungal.\nOn EGD, the patient\u2019s esophageal distention was found to be from a large bezoar which spanned from the broncho-aortic region of the esophagus to his lower esophageal sphincter. The bezoar was a phytobezoar, with evidence of medication and food particles (meat, vegetables) incorporated into it. The esophageal tissue appeared tenuous and appeared to be the cause of the patient\u2019s lab derangements (Fig. ).\nThe decompression was done carefully and meticulously by fragmenting the bezoar endoscopically using a snare device. About 2 h into the procedure, a repeat set of labs were drawn which showed significant improvement in his labs showing a WBC of now 7600/mcL (from 19,000/mcL), creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL (from 1.4 mg/dL), lactate of 0.86 mmol/L (from 3.94 mmol/L), and a troponin of 0.046 ng/mL (from 0.101 ng/mL). A discussion between the surgical team, anesthesia, and gastroenterology (via telephone) was done in the operating room for planning. Given his hemodynamic stability, improving lab values, and previous CT scan which showed no gross evidence of a leak, the decision was made to end the procedure for further resuscitation with plans to return to the OR for interval endoscopy to re-assess the esophagus. In the meantime, the patient was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics (to include antifungal coverage). He was kept Nil per os (NPO) and was admitted to the intensive care unit.\nThe patient remained hemodynamically normal and clinically stable throughout the night. The multi-disciplinary team determined the best course of action to be complete bezoar debridement, placement of NG tube, nutrition and medical optimization, workup for possible underlying esophageal pathology (to include completion EGD, manometry, and pH probe), and eventual endoscopic versus surgical management of determined condition. The above was again relayed to the patient and his family who fully supported the plan. The bezoar debridement was completed, and the esophagus was inspected for luminal integrity. An NG tube was able to be carefully placed under direct visualization.\nThe patient did well and was eventually able to be downgraded to the regular surgical floor. During his stay, a gastrostomy tube was obtained for feeding access and nutritional optimization. He would undergo several follow-up EGDs during his hospitalization to completely clear the bezoar and assess the esophageal lumen (Figs. and ). After discharge, the patient was further worked up and was found to have achalasia and esophagitis. Thorough workup includes a barium swallow study (patient\u2019s barium swallow shown in Fig. ), EGD, manometry, pH study, and a chest CT (for, among other things, surgical planning).

The patient's BMI can be computed using the formula weight(kg)/height^2(m). The patient's weight is 67.2 kg and his height is 173 cm or 1.73 m. Therefore, his BMI is 67.2/(1.73*1.73) = 22.4, which falls within the normal range (18.5-24.9). Hence we will use the minimum of the actual weight and ideal body weight to calculate creatinine clearance. An individual's ideal body weight can be calculated via the formula 50 (for men) + 2.3 kg for each inch over 5 feet, and subtracting 5 cm from the patient's height to fit this equation. Thus, this patient's height over 5 feet is 173-152.4 cm = 20.6 cm. Converting this to inches (as there are 2.54 cm in an inch) gives 20.6/2.54 = 8.1 inches. The ideal body weight for this patient therefore is 50 kg + 2.3 *8.1 = 68.6 kg. Since 67.2 kg is lower than 68.6 kg, we will use the actual body weight of 67.2 kg for the Cockroft-Gault equation. The Cockroft-Gault equation for a male patient is: (140 - age in years)*weight in kg / (72*serum creatinine in mg/dL). Plugging in the values for this patient yields (140-83)*67.2 / (72*1.4) = 40.3 mL/min.

She had poliomyelitis when she was very young, and there was nothing special regarding her family or psychosocial history. Serology was positive for perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA) and negative for anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA). Her condition was refractory to steroids and complicated by Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Ultimately, she underwent sub-total colectomy and ileostomy in February 2015. Pathological examination of the resection specimen showed diffuse pan-colitis consistent with UC and no indications of Crohn\u2019s disease (Fig. ). She did well in the following 11 months; prednisone was tapered and stopped within 2 months, and she gained 5 kg of weight after the ileostomy. In January 2016, a scheduled restorative ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) with proximal neo-ileostomy was performed.\nFrom one month after the IPAA, her 24-h stool collection slowly increased to 1.5\u20132 L. Next, she noticed decreased urine output since April. In early May 2016, she presented to our emergency room with repeated unconsciousness over the course of 10 days. Her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure (BP), 74/50 mmHg; heart rate (HR), 90 bpm; additionally, she exhibited a poor nutritional status (160 cm; 39 kg). On physical examination, active bowel sounds were noticed to occur approximately 7\u20139 times per minute. Her serum creatinine level was 183 \u03bcmol/L, indicating acute kidney injury. Treatment with fluid replacement and noradrenaline maintained her BP at 80\u201390/50\u201360 mmHg and gradually normalized her creatinine level. However, her 24-h watery stool collection persisted, and she developed fever and vomiting. While many leukocytes were found in stool collected from the diverted ileostomy, repeated stool cultures and tests for Clostridium difficile toxins were negative. Tests for CMV-DNA, CMV-pp65 and EBV-DNA were performed and were all negative. The patient was not on any medications, including NSAIDs, upon verification. Her treatment with steroids was stopped before the end of April 2015. Empirical treatment with antibiotics, including ceftazidime, metronidazole and oral vancomycin, was administered with no response. Due to her reliance on noradrenaline, relative adrenal insufficiency was suspected, and hydrocortisone was initiated at 50 mg q6 h intravenously. Her stool volume decreased to less than 500 ml per day quickly, by which time the treatment with noradrenaline was successfully stopped. The levels of D-lactate, endotoxin and diamine oxidase indicated that the barrier function of the intestine was compromised and that bacterial translocation may have occurred. Oedematous inflamed mucosa with patchy superficial ulcers was observed in the diverted pouch by pouchoscopy. Although an upper endoscopy and an endoscopy through a stoma revealed a normal gross appearance in the stomach, duodenum and pre-stomal ileum (Fig. a, b), the histological examination of tissue biopsies of both the duodenum and pre-stomal ileum revealed enteritis, as indicated by moderate villous atrophy, cryptitis, decreased goblet cells, and severe active inflammation with neutrophil infiltration in the lamina propria, as well as negativity for intraepithelial lymphocytosis (Fig. a-d). From these lines of evidence of histological enteritis presenting in the duodenum, pre-stomal ileum and diverted pouch, we considered pan-enteritis to be present, and we diagnosed the patient with post-colectomy enteritis. The patient was treated with methylprednisolone at 30 mg intravenously once a day with tapering by 5 mg every 7 to 10 days; however, her stool volume from the ileostomy still gradually increased to 3\u20134 L. After a multidisciplinary team discussion, ileostomy closure was debated as the final rescue treatment and was performed in August 2016. Two months later, her stool volume decreased to less than 1 L per day, and she gained 2.5 kg of weight. Azathioprine at 50 mg/d was prescribed during the tapering of prednisone. Until the last follow-up in March 2018, she performed well, with an increase in body weight to 50 kg, and daily defecation approximately 5\u20136 times at less than 1 L/day, sometimes with form (Additional file ). Gastroduodenal endoscopy and pouchoscopy were repeated annually and showed normal villi in the descending duodenum and neo-ileum in March 2018 (Fig. c, d).

The patient's ideal body weight could be calculated based on the formula 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg for each inch over 5 feet for females. She is 5 ft 3 in tall, so her ideal body weight is 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg * 3 = 52.4 kg. Her actual body weight is 105 kg. Therefore, her adjusted body weight is 52.4 kg + 0.4 * (105 kg - 52.4 kg) = 73.64 kg. Finally, I can substitute all these values into the Cockroft-Gault Equation: ((140 - age) * adjusted body weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72). Thus, the patient's Creatinine Clearance is ((140 - 42) * 73.64 * 0.85) / (0.8 * 72) = 77.8 mL/min.\", \"answer\": \"77.8\"}", "Ground Truth Answer": "106.192", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.\nThe patient's gender is female, which means that the gender coefficient is 0.85.\nThe patient is 42 years old. \nThe concentration of creatinine is 0.8 mg/dL. \nThe formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.\nThe patient's height is 160.0 cm, which is 160.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.6 m. The patient's weight is 105.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 105.0 kg / (1.6 m * 1.6 m) = 41.016 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 41.0, indicating they are overweight/obese.\nBecause the patient is overweight/obese, we use the adjusted body weight formula to get the adjusted weight used for Cockroft-Gault Equation.

A physical examination and an ultrasound showed a submucosal leiomyoma of the uterus. There were no other symptoms or pathological findings. Preoperative blood tests, which included electrolytes analyses, a full blood exam, and coagulation parameters, showed no anomalies. Most notably, both creatinine and sodium were within normal levels, i.e. 0.7 mg/dL and 137 mEq/L, respectively. The patient had a history of encephalopathy during childhood of an unknown origin without sequelae, an elective caesarean section (1997) due to leiomyoma, laparoscopic myomectomy and removal of an endometrial cyst of the ovary (1999), and a second caesarean section (2000) due to an uterine instability subsequent to the first caesarean section and myomectomy. The patient had no known allergies. She was taking daily doses of ethinyl estradiol (0.02 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.1 mg) continuously over a period of six months. The patient refused a hysterectomy but an endoscopic removal of the leiomyoma and an endometrial ablation was decided on, subsequent to which the patient gave written informed consent. The patient was administered with 7.5 mg midazolam orally 60 min preoperatively. Subsequent to placing the patient in the lithotomy position, the application of a peripheral venous catheter and the attachment of standard monitoring equipment (electrocardiogram, non-invasive blood pressure cuff and a peripheral capillary oxygen saturation analyzer), anaesthesia was induced intravenously with propofol (2 mg/kg) and sufentanil (0.3 \u03bcg/kg).\nA laryngeal mask was inserted, and after the correct positioning was verified, the lungs were ventilated with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.5 and a minute volume (MV) of 74 mL/min/kg at a ventilation frequency of 10/min in volume controlled mode (IPPV). The positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) level was 0 Pa and the peak pressure was 900 Pa. Anaesthesia was maintained with propofol (8 mg/kg/h). After anaesthesiological clearance the endoscopy commenced. Purisole\u00ae SM (Fresenius Kabi Inc., Germany) was utilized as the distension medium. This standard hypotonic solution contains 27 g sorbitol and 5.4 g mannitol per liter. A pressure of 16 kPa (120 mmHg) was applied to unfold the uterine cavity. Endometrial ablation and dissection of the submucosal myoma were performed within 70 min by monopolar resection. The duration of the procedure was prolonged due to the reduced visibility caused by excessive bleeding and cervical leakage of distension medium, which impeded proper expansion of the uterine cavity. The ventilation pressure increased slowly and continuously 60 min subsequent to the start of surgery. The compliance of the lungs, as well as the achievable minute volume within the acceptable airway pressure limit of 2 kPa, decreased. It was presumed that the level of anaesthesia was insufficient and was followed by the increased administration of propofol (10 mg/kg/h). The additional inhalation of fenoterol did, however, not improve the situation. As ventilation continued to be difficult, the laryngeal mask was replaced by a 7.0 cm (inside diameter) cuffed tube subsequent to the administration of 100 mg succinylcholine as a muscle relaxant. Approximately 50 mL of a foamy, transparent liquid was aspirated from the trachea. Testing with litmus paper indicated an alkaline pH and, therefore, not the aspiration of gastric content. The amount of the pulmonary oedema increased and, despite high levels of peak airway pressures at this point approximately 3 kPa (= set peak pressure limit), adequate ventilation was not possible. Blood gas and electrolyte analyses indicated acidosis, as well as a severe hyponatremia (pH 7.11; Na 74 mEq/L; partial pressure of CO2 49.9 mmHg; saturation of O2 97 % at FiO2 1.0). Cardiopulmonary changes remained minimal. 40 mg of furosemide and 500 mL of 3 % NaCl solution were immediately administered at an infusion rate of 500 mL/h, with constant monitoring for electrolyte changes. As the patient showed clinical signs of impaired haemostasis, the operation procedure was stopped. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit with continuous administration of 3 % NaCl at a rate of 50 mL/h and electrolyte control. Plasma sodium levels increased from 74 mEq/L to 103 mEq/L after one hour, and to 130 mEq/L after 7 h (Fig. ). All together 800 mL of 3 % NaCl solution were administered within 7 h totalling at 24 g. Subsequently, sodium replenishment was stopped and the patient was extubated without problems. Immediate neurological assessment revealed no detectable deficits. 20 h after the onset of hyponatremia, the patient\u2019s sodium levels returned to within the normal range. Until then, the cumulative renal excretion was 8.5 L. 9 L of distension medium was used intraoperatively with a calculated uptake of 5 L.

This patient is a 45-year-old female, with a weight of 58 kg and a serum creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL. Her height is 156 cm. To determine the adjusted body weight, we need to calculate the patient's BMI. We can convert height from cm to m, getting 1.56 m. The formula to calculate BMI is weight (kg) / (height (m))^2, so we plug in the patient's data getting: 58 / (1.56)^2 = 23.8 kg/m^2. With a BMI of 23.8, the patient is considered to have normal weight. Therefore, to calculate her adjusted weight, we should use the minimum of her actual weight and ideal weight. Ideal body weight (IBW) for females can be calculated using the formula: 45.5 kg + 0.91 * (height in cm - 152.4). For this patient, the IBW is: 45.5 kg + 0.91 * (156 - 152.4) = 48.714 kg. The adjusted weight is thus the minimum of the actual weight (58 kg) and the IBW (48.714 kg), which yields 48.714 kg.

Prior to this, the patient had consumed 540 mL of sake three times a week, and he had been reducing the amount of alcohol he consumed for about one year. He did not smoke or take any recreational drugs. He was single, was not homosexual, and he had not had sexual intercourse for over one year.\nThe patient had undergone treatment of his internal hemorrhoids as an outpatient at a nearby hospital that comprised an aluminum potassium sulfate and tannic acid (ALTA) injection. He developed a fever of 38 \u00b0C, dark colored urine, and itchy skin on postoperative day (POD) 1, and he took loxoprofen sodium, as required. He consulted another doctor on POD 7, because the symptoms had not improved, and his blood test results led to a diagnosis of liver dysfunction. His liver dysfunction had not improved by POD 14, and he was admitted to our hospital on POD 15.\nThe patient was 167 cm tall and weighed 52.5 kg. He presented with a blood pressure of 103/59 mmHg, a heart rate of 82 beats per minute, a temperature of 36.6 \u00b0C, and 99% oxygen saturation in room air. No specific physical findings were evident during the clinical examination on the day of hospitalization, but the patient had a rash, edema, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and jaundice. The subjective symptoms, comprising the fever, dark colored urine, and itchy skin, had disappeared by POD 10.\nThe laboratory test results showed that the patient\u2019s complete blood count was almost normal with a white blood cell count of 6900 cells/\u03bcL, a hemoglobin concentration of 14.7 g/dL, a hematocrit level of 43.1%, and a platelet count of 3.98 \u00d7 105 cells/\u03bcL, but a higher percentage of eosinophils was present (6.8%) (normal: 1.0%-5.0%), which peaked at 13.9% on POD 20. The patient\u2019s serum liver enzyme and bilirubin levels were elevated at the time of admission. The aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level was 432 IU/L (normal: 10-40 IU/L), the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was 911 IU/L (normal: 10-40 IU/L), the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level was 473 IU/L (normal: 115-359 IU/L), and the total bilirubin level was 1.3 mg/dL (normal: 0.2-1.2 mg/dL). Thus, compared with the ALP level, the AST and ALT levels showed greater magnitudes of elevation. The patient\u2019s other blood test results were within the normal ranges, as follows: serum albumin: 4.0 g/dL (normal: 3.8-5.2 g/dL); serum creatinine: 0.86 mg/dL (normal: 0.65-1.09 mg/dL); C-reactive protein: 0.1 mg/dL (normal: 0-0.3 mg/dL); prothrombin time: 100% (normal: 80%-120 %); thyroid-stimulating hormone: 0.5 \u03bcIU/mL (normal: 0.34-4.04 \u03bcIU/mL); triiodothyronine: 2.98 pg/dL (normal: 2.36-5.00 pg/dL); and thyroxin: 1.18 ng/dL (normal: 0.88-1.67 ng/dL). The serological tests for autoantibodies generated weakly positive results (1:40) for anti-nuclear antibodies, and negative results for anti-smooth muscle and anti-mitochondrial antibodies. Negative results were obtained from the tests for the hepatitis B virus surface antigen, the hepatitis C virus antibody, rapid plasma reagin, the anti-Epstein-Barr virus immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody, and the anti-cytomegalovirus IgM antibody, and from the Treponema pallidum hemagglutination test. The IgG level was within the normal range at 1415 mg/dL (normal: 800-1600 mg/dL) and the IgM level was within the normal range at 100 mg/dL (normal: 60-250 mg/dL). The IgE level was elevated at 1333 mg/dL (normal: < 250 mg/dL). Chest radiography did not reveal any abnormalities. No morphological changes were evident following abdominal ultrasonography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, and abdominal computed tomography (Figure ).\nWhen the patient was hospitalized, we considered viral, alcohol-induced, autoimmune, drug-induced, biliary tract, and thyroid function-based diseases as frequent causes of acute liver dysfunction for the differential diagnosis, and, based on the patient\u2019s medical history, and the serological and imaging results, we considered that alcohol and DILI were highly likely causes of the patient\u2019s acute liver dysfunction. However, the patient had stopped drinking during the past year, so we thought that there was a high likelihood of DILI. Therefore, we began conservative treatment with a small amount of extracellular fluid replacement.\nFigure presents the patient\u2019s symptoms, laboratory test results, and treatment over the entire course. The liver transaminase and bilirubin levels decreased rapidly after admission, and the maximum levels were as follows: ALT: 950 IU/L on POD 15; AST: 470 IU/L on POD 17; and total bilirubin: 2.1 mg/dL on POD 17. The ALP and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels showed consistent downward trends from POD 7. The patient's symptoms disappeared on POD 10, and no new symptoms appeared after hospitalization. We performed a liver biopsy on POD 25, and a drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST) of the components of the ALTA injection and lidocaine on POD 28. The patient was discharged on POD 29, and he was managed as an outpatient without any prescriptions. At the time of the patient\u2019s first outpatient appointment on POD 35, his liver transaminase and bilirubin levels had declined and were almost within the normal ranges.\nFigure presents hematoxylin and eosin (H and E)-stained sections of the liver biopsy performed on POD 25. The H and E staining showed that the basic structure of the liver had been maintained without any hepatocyte dropout or disruption, and that the bile duct had not been disrupted. At a higher magnification, the H and E staining showed that the parenchymal cells were partially dilated and that a mild inflammatory cell infiltration was present in the area of the central vein. Neither eosinophil nor plasma cell infiltrations were detected within the liver tissue. Bile plugs were found at multiple sites within the parenchyma and sinusoids. Masson staining did not show the presence of liver tissue fibrosis.\nThe lymphocyte proliferation activity levels, which were determined from the DLST performed on POD 28, were 676 counts per minute (cpm) for the control and 871 cpm for the ALTA with lidocaine.

Two months previously, he developed symptoms of right ptosis and progressive swallowing difficulty. Based on a positive response to edrophonium and increased titers of autoantibodies to acetylcholine receptor (19.3 nmol/L; normal < 0.2 nmol/L), he was diagnosed as having MG with severity belonging to Osserman's classification IIb (ie, generalized moderate weakness and/or bulbar dysfunction). Thoracic computed tomography demonstrated glandular hyperplasia of the thymus (Fig. A). The patient was started on prednisolone 20 mg daily and pyridostigmine 60 mg three times daily. His past history included hypertension without evidence of previous myasthenic crisis or thromboembolic events (eg, history of lower limb swelling). The results of electrocardiography, pulmonary function test [eg, vital capacity: 93%], echocardiography (eg, left ventricular ejection fraction: 85.1%), chest radiography (Fig. B), and laboratory studies (eg, coagulation test) were unremarkable. On the other hand, impaired renal function [i.e., serum creatinine: 1.42 mg/dL; eGFR: 49.1 mL/min/1.73 m2] was observed after admission.\nPreoperative physical examination of the patient showed clear consciousness without respiratory distress. Vital signs included a blood pressure of 187/103 mm Hg, heart rate of 82 beats/min, and respiratory rate of 14 breaths/minute. Under real-time neuromuscular monitoring with a train-of-four (TOF) monitor (TOF-watch SX, N.V. Organon, Oss, Netherlands), anesthesia was induced with propofol (130 mg) and rocuronium (0.85 mg/kg). Following successful tracheal intubation with a double-lumen tracheal tube (Broncho-Cath; Mallinckrodt, Athlone, Ireland), general anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane, rocuronium (total dosage: 40 mg), and a continuous infusion of remifentanil. An 18-gauge peripheral intravenous line and an arterial line were introduced. The surgical time was 4 hours 15 minutes with an estimated blood loss of 100 mL. Upon completion of surgery, sugammadex 4 mg/kg was administered to reverse neuromuscular blockade, with a maximum TOF ratio of 0.93 following reversal. Additionally, intravenous morphine 8 mg was given for postoperative analgesia. After successful extubation in the operating room and resumption of spontaneous breathing, he was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for further care.\nDuring the immediate postoperative period, the patient was hemodynamically stable without respiratory distress. Because of surgical pain with a numeric rating scale of 5 (scale of 0\u201310), intravenous morphine was titrated to a total dosage of 7 mg. Forty-five minutes later, respiratory distress with drowsiness was noted. Physical examination found pinpoint pupils with a TOF ratio of 0.9. Blood gas analysis demonstrated severe hypercapnia (arterial carbon dioxide pressure: 117.7 mm Hg) and acidosis (pH: 6.996, lactate levels: 3.3 mmol/L). On suspicion of morphine overdose, intravenous naloxone was administered twice (0.08 mg each time). After 20 minutes, the patient regained consciousness and normal respiratory pattern. Subsequent blood gas analysis demonstrated hyperlactatemia (lactate levels: 6.0 mmol/L) (Fig. ) despite improvement in arterial carbon dioxide pressure and arterial oxygen pressure after naloxone administration. Taking into account the overall clinical improvement, he was transferred to ward with spontaneous breathing and stable hemodynamics after observation for 100 minutes following initial reversal of opioid overdose.\nHowever, one hour after being transferred to ward (ie, three hours after naloxone administration), he was found to exhibit consciousness loss, respiratory distress, and pinpoint pupils. Intravenous naloxone 0.4 mg was given, followed by endotracheal intubation and transfer to the intensive care unit for mechanical ventilatory support. Brain computed tomography showed no intracranial lesion. He regained consciousness two hours after naloxone administration in the intensive care unit without symptoms of opioid withdrawal (eg, pulmonary edema). As weaning from mechanical ventilation was difficult on POD 3, a diagnosis of POMC was made. Steroid therapy (prednisolone 40 mg twice daily) and pyridostigmine (60 mg 3 times a day) was initiated. The patient was extubated smoothly on POD 6 and was discharged from hospital on POD 12. The course of hyperlactatemia was shown in Figure . In addition, his eGFR increased from 49.1 mL/min/1.73 m2 at baseline to 88.9 ml/min/1.73m2 on POD 5. Pathological analysis of the specimen from thymectomy confirmed the diagnosis of type B2 thymoma according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification.\nThe patient was readmitted on POD 24 because of left thigh swelling. Ultrasonographic examination showed evidence of DVT involving the left femoral and popliteal veins. Anticoagulant therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin (ie, subcutaneous Clexane 60 mg every 12 hours) was implemented immediately after hospitalization, and he was discharged without sequelae on POD 31. During hospitalization, his eGFR was 86.5 mL/min/1.73m2.

The patient's weight is 59 kg, and their height is 155 cm, which is 1.55 m. We use the BMI formula, BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))^2. This gives us a BMI of 24.6 kg/m2. This is within the normal range (18.5-24.9 kg/m2). Given this, we need to calculate the patient's ideal body weight and use the lower of the actual and ideal weights for the Cockcroft-Gault calculation. The formulas for calculating ideal body weight are: 50 + 0.91 * (height_in_cm - 152.4) for men and 45.5 + 0.91 * (height_in_cm - 152.4) for women. Given that the patient is male, the ideal weight is thus 52.73 kg. This is lower than their actual weight, hence we use 52.73 kg in the Cockcroft-Gault equation.\\nThe Cockcroft-Gault equation is (140 - age) * weight * (0.85 if female) / (72 * serum creatinine), where the weight is in kilograms, the age is in years, and the serum creatinine level is in mg/dL.

She had been treated for ischemic cardiomyopathy with triple vessel disease at another hospital, but had been hospitalized for heart failure 12 times in the last two years. Echocardiography that was performed in the hospital reportedly revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30%. The patient had a history of left thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer at the age of 67 years with no subsequent recurrence. Comorbidities included angina pectoris, chronic heart failure, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, and gastric ulcer (gastrointestinal bleeding with antithrombotic drugs). Her usual medications were tolvaptan 7.5 mg, azosemide 60 mg, furosemide 60 mg, rabeprazole 10 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, bisoprolol 0.625 mg, amiodarone 50 mg, levothyroxine sodium 50 \u03bcg, cremedin 6 g, and sodium ferrous citrate 100 mg. Her ability to perform activities of daily living was good, and there was no history of alcohol drinking, smoking, or allergy. She noticed shortness of breath and chest discomfort when she was about to go to the restroom in the morning, and was transported by ambulance to the emergency department of our hospital.\nPhysical findings on admission were: height, 153 cm; weight, 53 kg; body mass index, 22.6 kg/m2; body temperature, 36.9\u2103; blood pressure, 155/94 mmHg; heart rate, 83/min and regular; respiratory rate, 22/min; and SpO2, 98% (O2, 6 L). The palpebral conjunctiva was not pale, and jugular venous distention was observed. There were coarse crackles in both lung fields and no murmurs. There was no peripheral coldness in the limbs and lower leg edema was observed. A 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) showed sinus rhythm at 71 beats/min, no ST elevation, and a negative T wave in leads V3-6 (Figure ). The corrected QT interval (QTc) was prolonged by 556 ms.\nChest radiography showed a cardiothoracic ratio of 70%, indicating cardiomegaly, pulmonary congestion, and bilateral pleural effusion (Figure ).\nEchocardiography showed akinesis mainly at the apex and diffuse hypokinesis at the base, showing systolic dysfunction with LVEF of 15%. The blood tests revealed decreased renal function with a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 88 mg/dL, creatinine level of 3.26 mg/dL, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 11.1 mL/min/BSA.The serum albumin level was 3.3 g/dL and serum potassium level was 4.5 mmol/L. Creatine kinase (CK) was slightly elevated at 191 U/L, but the creatine kinase-myocardial band (2.8 ng/mL) and troponin I (0.02 ng/mL) levels were not elevated. The level of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) was 802.7 pg/mL. A diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure was made, and treatment with oxygen and diuretics (furosemide 20mg) was started. The patient responded well and urine volumes in the initial three hours were 400 mL; however, 12 hours after admission, she experienced sudden onset chest pain and pain radiating to the neck. Consciousness at the time of the attack was clear, systolic blood pressure was 120 mmHg, heart rate was 80/min with sinus rhythm, and SpO2 was 89% (O2 10 L). The pain extended to the extremities. The 12-lead ECG at the time of the attack was not significantly different from that at the time of admission (Figure ). Chest radiography showed worsening pulmonary congestion (Figure ). Echocardiography and blood sampling showed no marked change from that on admission, no increase in cardiac enzymes, and no findings strongly suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. When respiratory management by noninvasive positive pressure ventilation was continued, symptoms improved after approximately one hour. Although serum calcium and magnesium levels were not measured at the time of admission, additional examinations revealed hypocalcemia with a calcium level of 4.9 mg/dL and hypomagnesemia with a magnesium level of 1.7 mg/dL. The phosphorus level was 6.3 mg/dL. It was considered that the symptoms were due to a tetanic seizure. The cause of hypocalcemia was thought to be chronic kidney disease (CKD) because parathyroid function, as reflected by intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), was preserved (122.7 pg/mL) despite prior operation on the thyroid gland. Since the level of consciousness and symptoms did not deteriorate, calcium correction was started by oral administration while magnesium was corrected by drip infusion. The patient rapidly responded to intravenous infusion of magnesium and oral administration of calcium and vitamin D preparations. Serum calcium normalized on day 6 of hospitalization and the corrected calcium level was 9.1 mg/dL at the time of discharge. The QTc on ECG decreased from 556 to 491 ms (Figure ). The electrolyte abnormality improved without subsequent recurrence of tetany. The LVEF by echocardiography improved from 15% to 27% at the time of discharge. Although coronary angiography was not performed because of renal dysfunction, the LV contraction failure may have been affected by hypocalcemia.

In the past 3 years, coil embolization of the hepatic artery and percutaneous drainage of liver cysts had been performed. After the liver cyst drainage, biliary peritonitis occurred and she was treated with antibiotics.\nPreoperative computed tomography revealed remarkable abdominal distension caused by an enlarged polycystic liver (). Results of laboratory tests were as follows: hemoglobin (Hb), 10.1 g/dL; platelet (Plt) count, 27.4 \u00d7 104/\u03bcL; albumin, 2.2 g/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 31.3 mg/dL; creatinine, 0.90 mg/dL; total bilirubin, 0.31 mg/dL; alanine transaminase, 13 U/L; aspartate transaminase, 15 U/L; prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR), 1.18; activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), 30.0 sec; fibrinogen, 573 mg/dL. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm, and transthoracic echocardiography showed normal cardiac function. Portal hypertension was not predicted. The surgeons pointed out a risk of bleeding because of surgical difficulties due to PLD and strong adhesion induced by peritonitis. Blood loss anticipated by the surgeon was 15000 ml. The transfusion unit was preoperatively informed about the possibility of massive transfusion. We ordered 5,600 mL of O type red blood cells (RBC), 4,800 mL of AB type fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 800 mL of AB type platelet concentrate (PC).\nAfter induction of general anesthesia, three 18-gauge peripheral catheters, a 12-gauge triple-lumen central venous catheter, and a pulmonary arterial catheter were placed. Since total clamping of the inferior vena cava requiring veno-veno bypass might be necessary, two 4-Fr introducer sheaths were placed at the femoral vein and the intrajugular vein. Soon after the start of surgery, massive bleeding of more than 4,000 mL/hr occurred (). We started massive transfusion of FFP at a ratio of about 1 : 1 with RBC. We also transfused 5% albumin and restricted the crystalloid solution. Reinfusion of salvaged blood and use of veno-veno bypass with retrieved blood from the operative field were avoided because many cysts of the PLD ruptured during surgery and the blood in the operative field was contaminated by the cystic content. We constantly ordered blood products and communicated with the transfusion unit.\nThe bleeding rate increased as the surgery progressed because bleeding occurred from the area where the tissue was detached from adhesion. Body temperature rapidly decreased despite the use of a rapid infusion and fluid warming system (Level 1 Fast Flow Fluid Warmer, Smiths Medical ASD Inc., Rockland, MA, USA) through 4-Fr introducer sheaths. Although catecholamine administration and massive transfusion from 5 venous lines including the introducer sheath were performed by many anesthesiologists, it was extremely difficult to maintain blood pressure and a critical situation with a risk of cardiac arrest continued due to hypotension. In addition, even though administration of insulin and calcium was performed, electrolyte disturbances of K+ of 6.3 mEq/L and Ca2+ of 2.1 mg/dL (normal range: 4.6\u20135.3 mg/dL) with peaked T wave and prolongation of QTc interval (557 msec) occurred (Figures and ). At that time, we visually noticed that the QT interval was shortened in response to bolus calcium administration, and we therefore displayed the QTc interval on a bedside monitor (CSM-1000 series Life Scope G, Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan) and used the change of real-time QTc interval as a supportive indicator for calcium correction (maximum rate: 120 mEq/hr) combined with blood gas analysis. The hepatectomy was performed without veno-veno bypass 4.5 hours after the start of surgery and the bleeding rate at that time was 15,000 mL/hr (). The excised polycystic liver weighed 10.0 kg.\nUntil portal reperfusion, we continued massive transfusion (approximately 12,000 mL/hr) including 300 mL of PC and sodium bicarbonate with additional fluid warming systems. After portal reperfusion, the bleeding rate gradually decreased and the hemodynamic variables and electrolyte disturbance improved (Figures and ; ). After anastomosis of the hepatic artery, 1 g of tranexamic acid was administered. Except for PC, which was transported from transfusion centers in our region and/or neighboring regions, the supply of blood products was not interrupted and coagulation factors were maintained throughout the surgery by administration of FFP and 3 g of fibrinogen with at least 1.26 of PT-INR, 43.6 sec of APTT, and 116 mg/dL of fibrinogen (). The abdomen was packed with gauzes and closed because complete hemostasis was difficult. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Soon after arrival at the ICU, she responded to command. On postoperative day (POD) 2, second-look surgery was performed for removal of packed gauzes. She was extubated on POD 3 without pulmonary edema or cardiac overload.\nThe duration of surgery was 16 hours and 53 minutes and the duration of general anesthesia was 22 hours and 27 minutes. Throughout the surgery, anesthesia was maintained with 1.5% sevoflurane, 0.16\u20130.33 \u03bcg\u22121 \u30fbkg\u22121 \u30fbmin\u22121 of remifentanil, and intermittent fentanyl administration (total of 1.5 mg).

A total of 742 mEq of calcium ion, 750 mL of 7% sodium bicarbonate, and 18 units of insulin were administered. Postoperative analysis of the relationship between QTc interval and Ca2+ during surgery showed a strong negative correlation (). Representative laboratory data are shown in . Total infusion volume was 88,560 mL (crystalloid solution: 3,450 mL; 6% hydroxyethyl starch: 3,500 mL; 5% albumin: 10,490 mL; RBC: 34,160 mL; FFP: 34,600 mL; PC: 2,400 mL), and total output volume was 86,350 mL (estimated volume of blood loss including ascites and cystic fluid: 81,600 mL; urine output: 4,750 mL); therefore, intraoperative fluid balance was +2,210 mL.

He showed the relapse of infection of liver cysts and received longtime antibiotics therapies.\nOn admission, his vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 39.4 \u00b0C; heart rate, 101 beats per minutes (bpm); and respiratory rate, 20 bpm. Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7480 cells/mm3 with a high neutrophil count of 90.7%, and a C reactive protein of 18.08 mg/dl. He was diagnosed as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) showed an abnormal high intensity at the multiple liver cysts, indicating that polycystic infection was strongly suspected. Although antibiotic therapy with intravenous meropenem at a dose of 0.5 g/day was started, fever and inflammatory reactions were unable to improve. Therefore, percutaneous echo-guided drainage was introduced for the most accumulated liver cyst. Because of the improvements of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, the drainage tube was removed at 19 days after drainage. However, the low-grade fever and inflammatory reactions recurred, and the discontinuation of antibiotic therapy was difficult. Because the most of the liver showed multilocular cystic changes, the control of infection was considered to be difficult by conservative treatments such as a local drainage or a partial liver resection, and the severe infection was expected to be repeated in the future.\nAs a fundamental treatment, a surgical approach was considered to be necessary, and a liver transplantation surgery was considered to be an indication for the disease. Therefore, he was planned to undergo living-donor liver transplantation with a right lobe graft from his wife. The graft was selected with considering a graft-to-recipient weight ratio of 0.88%, which is larger than the minimal recommended ratio of 0.8%.\nBefore the liver transplantation, he was 168.0 cm tall and weighed 68 kg. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly extending below the level of the umbilicus. Laboratory data showed anemia (Hb 10.4 g/dL), and the elevation of C-reactive protein (2.61 mg/dL). Liver and renal profiles were as follows: total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 17 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 10 U/L; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.3; creatinine, 5.09 mg/dL. His Child-Pugh score was 7 (grade B), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 22. Arterial blood gas analysis showed that blood pH was 7.44, PaCO2 32.9 mmHg, PaO2, 82.1 mmHg in room air, and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient (A-aDO2) was increased to 26.8 mmHg. Chest X-ray revealed an elevation of right diaphragm. Computed tomography (CT) showed hepatomegaly with multiple liver cysts, multiple renal cysts, mild ascites, and no abnormal findings in the lung (Fig. ). Respiratory function test showed the forced vital capacity (FVC) was mildly reduced down to 72% of predicted value, and the adjusted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLco) by Cotes\u2019 method was moderately reduced down to 57.8% of predicted value. Venous ultrasonography revealed lower extremity venous thrombosis, and the day before the operation, an inferior vena cava filter was inserted by a right internal-jugular-vein approach without any complications. At 114 days after admission, a living related liver transplantation was performed. After endotracheal intubation, two central venous catheters were inserted from left and right internal jugular veins before surgery without any complications.\nGeneral anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. The artificial ventilation was uneventful, and the airway pressure was kept below 30 cmH2O during the intraoperative period.\nThe abdominal cavity was reached through the upper abdominal reverse-T incision. The liver was found to swell markedly and to push the right diaphragm upward. Although the liver was firmly adhered to the right diaphragm, the adhesion was sharply dissected by electrocautery under appropriate traction. After the extraction of the liver, the right diaphragm was found to swell markedly and occupy the abdominal cavity. Although there was no significant change in the vital signs, the right pneumothorax was suspected, a thoracic drain was immediately inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and continuous drainage was initiated. However, the right diaphragm distended by a massive air leak and prevented the operators from anastomosing the liver vessels and the bile duct. Therefore, a small relaxing incision was made in the right diaphragm for depressurizing the right thoracic cavity and making an adequate operative field to anastomose. Thoracoscopic observation was performed through the diaphragm incision. There was no adhesion in the right thoracic cavity, and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the right lung was widely expanded like a giant cyst due to dissection from the lung parenchyma, and a marked air leak was recognized from a pin hole in the dissected pleura. Since controlling the air leakage in the patient was considered difficult only by drainage, a leakage closure operation was decided to be performed after the completion of the liver transplantation. Following the transplantation procedure, the thoracoscopic leakage closure operation was performed for the patient in the supine position.\nDuring operation, a thoracoscope was inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and endoscopic surgical instruments were inserted through the small diaphragm incision (Fig. ). The expanded visceral pleura was incised by electrocautery to drain air and pooled blood in the cyst, and bleeding sites in the lung parenchyma were identified and controlled by electric coagulation. Because the lung parenchyma and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the lung was widely dissected and the base of the cyst was large, cystectomy was found to be difficult to be performed by a stapler or sutures. For controlling the air leakage, absorbable fibrin sealant patches (TachoSil\u00ae, Baxtor Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA) were patched on the lung parenchyma under dissected visceral pleura, and fibrin glue (Beriplast P\u00ae, CSL Behring, Tokyo, Japan) was injected into the dissected space. After no air pooling was confirmed under the visceral pleura with positive pressure ventilation, polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets (Neoveil\u00ae, Gunze, Kyoto) were applied, and fibrin glue was sprayed on the visceral pleura surface (Fig. ). Finally, a 21Fr silicone thoracic tube was inserted through the right 10th intercostal space and placed on the apex of right thoracic cavity, and the diaphragm and abdominal incision was closed. Although a postoperative minor air leakage was observed, chest X-ray showed the complete expansion of the right lung. The patient was treated with water seal drainage. After the air leakage disappeared, the drainage tube was removed at 27 days after surgery. The course after liver transplantation was also smooth, and he was discharged at 67 days after surgery. The cyst on the bottom of the right lung was confirmed to disappear on chest CT after discharge (Fig. ).", "Question": "What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?

He was diagnosed with hypertension at the age of 40 years, and his blood pressure was poorly controlled with a calcium channel blocker (nifedipine at 40 mg/d). He also had a past medical history of vasospastic angina and was a nonsmoker and social drinker. In addition, he had no family history of cardiovascular diseases. On admission, the patient was 168 cm tall and weighed 59 kg. He was afebrile, with a blood pressure of 161/96 mm Hg and a regular pulse of 61 beats per minute. There was no evidence of lung rales, cardiac murmurs, or an abdominal bruit. His neurological examination was unremarkable. Laboratory tests revealed that his serum creatinine level was 1.1 mg/dL, urea nitrogen level was 19 mg/dL, and serum sodium level was 140 mEq/L. He also exhibited hypokalemia with a serum potassium concentration of 2.9 mEq/L; however, he had no subjective symptoms, including muscle weakness. Plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), and aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) were <0.1 ng/mL/h, 292 pg/mL, and >2920, respectively. Other adrenal hormone levels were within normal limits. A chest radiograph and transthoracic echocardiogram showed no significant findings. An electrocardiogram suggested nonspecific ST-T wave changes with premature atrial contractions.\nPrimary hyperaldosteronism was suspected, and therefore, a captopril challenge test and a saline infusion test were performed. All these investigations revealed positive test results (Table ), which confirmed a diagnosis of PA. A low-dose dexamethasone suppression test to exclude the diagnosis of subclinical Cushing's syndrome was negative. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, which showed a left adrenal mass (13 mm) (Figure ). In adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-stimulated AVS, although aldosterone hypersecretion was observed in the left adrenal gland, the lateralization of the disease was not determined due to incomplete cannulation of the right adrenal vein (Table ). The criteria of successful cannulation were based on the current Expert Consensus Statement.\n131I-adosterol scintigraphy under dexamethasone suppression showed an equivalently increased uptake in both adrenal glands (Figure ). Because we could not exclude the bilateral PA, including aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) with microadenoma in the right adrenal gland, we performed the medical therapy with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA). Although we administrated multiple antihypertensive agents including an MRA (eplerenone at 100 mg/d), an angiotensin II receptor blocker (azilsartan at 40 mg/d), a dual action beta blocker/alpha-1 blocker (carvedilol at 20 mg/d), a calcium channel blocker with an increased dose (nifedipine at 80 mg/d), an alpha-1 blocker (doxazosin at 2 mg/d), and an alpha-2 agonist (guanabenz at 4 mg/d), a home reading of the patient's blood pressure was above 140/90 mm Hg. Moreover, he needed a large quantity of potassium chloride to compensate for his hypokalemia.\nDespite intensive medical therapy, he underwent percutaneous coronary intervention due to stable angina. Following this, we performed AVS again, but the right adrenal vein was not successfully cannulated (Table ). We discussed further the indication for surgery and decided to remove the left adrenal gland. After laparoscopic left adrenalectomy, his blood pressure and serum potassium remained normal after the withdrawal of eplerenone, doxazosin, guanabenz, and potassium chloride and a dose reduction of azilsartan (at 20 mg/d), carvedilol (at 10 mg/d), and nifedipine (at 10 mg/d). The PRA and PAC were 0.8 ng/mL/h and 57.1 pg/mL, 3 months after the adrenalectomy, respectively. Macroscopic findings of the resected specimen showed a yellowish colored nodule (13 mm in diameter) in the adrenal gland.

He was born via cesarean section because of placenta previa at gestational age of 37 weeks with birth weight of 2.7 kg. Due to positive family history (his brother had MMA), he underwent metabolic investigation. His metabolic evaluation revealed blood ammonia level of 400\u2013500 mg/dL and elevated C3 carnitine level (48.8; reference range, < 4.1). The methylmalonic acid level in urine was 1617 \u00b5g/mg Cr, and elevation in plasma glycine (415 \u00b5mol/L) and alanine (978 \u00b5mol/L) levels were noted. Cobalamin (Cbl) incorporation study of 14C-propionate showed lack of response to Cbl (i.e. mut0) and slightly low response to adocobalamin (AdoCbl). Molecular investigations revealed a compound heterozygous c.1105C > T(p.R369C), p.G94Q mutation. He was fed with special formula (Propiomex), regular infant formula, low-protein food, and L-carnitine supplement (100 mg/kg/d). His developmental evaluation at 20 months of age showed a mild delay. Prior to 5 years of age, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine were in the normal range (BUN 6.6\u201312.3 mg/dL /creatinine 0.7\u20130.8 mg/dL). However, after 5.5 years of age, his renal function slowly deteriorated, showing a BUN level of 16.2\u201329.2 and creatinine level of 0.81\u20131.02. He was hospitalized multiple times due to metabolic decompensations (acidosis, dehydration, and hyperammonemia) after trivial infections or skipping of the special formula. At 6 years of age, his eye sight deteriorated progressively and he became legally blind due to optic atrophy by 10 years of age. He received growth hormone treatment for metabolic induction to anabolism and improvement of his short stature. At 15 years of age, he experienced vomiting and abdominal pain due to pancreatitis. His metabolic status became unstable; he was hospitalized more than 7 times with pancreatitis (Table ). At this time, he began to experience hand tremors due to his metabolic condition. After recurrent pancreatitis at 19 years of age, he showed glucose intolerance. By the age of 20 years, he developed DM, requiring insulin injection. His most recent metabolic crisis was accompanied by severe metabolic acidosis (pH 6.8), liver dysfunction (aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 245 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 316 IU/L), hyperventilation, hemorrhagic gastritis, and left pleural effusion. His pancreatic amylase and lipase levels were > 4000 U/L. He was put on continuous renal replacement therapy for 3 days. During the metabolic crisis, he experienced seizures and hand tremors, although the results of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalogram (EEG) were normal. The abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed necrotizing pancreatitis and follow-up ultrasound after 1 month of pancreatitis showed a pancreatic pseudocyst.

No prophylactic antibiotics were administered to the patient during the EVT procedure. The patient was discharged the next day without any complications. However, he developed fever and back pain 20 days later. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) was suggestive of an infected aneurysm at the site of the left iliac artery stent, and the patient was referred to our hospital.\nThe patient was 160 cm tall, weighed 62.8 kg, and had a blood pressure of 156/80 mmHg, a pulse of 66 beats/min, and a body temperature of 38\u00b0C.

CT findings revealed thickening of the arterial wall and an aneurysm of the left common iliac artery at the site of the stent (). On the basis of these findings, he was diagnosed with an infected aneurysm due to bare stent infection and underwent surgical treatment.\nThe terminal abdominal aorta and bilateral common iliac arteries were removed because the infection had extended to the aortic bifurcation (). The surrounding infected tissue was debrided, and the terminal aorta was replaced with a rifampicin-soaked bifurcated prosthesis. A pedicled omental flap based on the left gastroepiploic artery was then guided in a retrocolic fashion into the retroperitoneal cavity, to wrap the graft around its entire length.\nThe rifampicin-soaked prosthesis was prepared as follows. First, 300-mg rifampicin capsules (Sandoz Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) were dissolved in a mixture of 6-ml high-pressure sterilized polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate (Tween 80, Wako Seiyaku, Tokyo, Japan) and 54-ml distilled water. This solution was then sterilized in a Millex-HV Syringe Filter Unit (0.45 \u00b5m polyvinylidene difluoride, Merck Millipore, Carrigtwohill, County Cork, Ireland). Finally, an 18\u00d710-mm prosthesis (Hemashield Platinum, Maquet, San Jose, CA, USA) was soaked in this rifampicin solution for 15 min.\nHistopathology of the surgically excised artery specimen revealed many inflammatory cells infiltrating the intima, media, and adventitia. Abscesses and masses of Gram-positive cocci were found in all arterial layers, suggestive of an infected aneurysm ().\nStaphylococcus aureus was detected by a bacterial culture of the surgical specimen. Based on the results of his antibiotic susceptibility test, the patient was administered tazobactam/piperacillin 13.5 g/day intravenously for 4 weeks, followed by amoxicillin 750 mg/day orally. However, oral medication was discontinued after 2 weeks due to a side effect, i.e., diarrhea.\nTwo postoperative complications were also treated. For adhesive bowel obstruction, partial small bowel resection was performed. For aspiration pneumonia, meropenem hydrate 1.5 g/day was administered for 1 week.\nThe patient was discharged and fully recovered from his illness. The patient still visits our hospital every 3\u20136 months for blood tests, Doppler ultrasonography, and CT. Postoperative CT images at the 2-year follow-up revealed no signs of reinfection ().

Her height was 155.5 cm and body weight was 61.0 kg. Laboratory data showed a creatinine of 1.4 mg/dl, potassium 2.8 mmol/l, calcium 9.5 mg/dl, phosphorus 2.5 mg/dl, uric acid 1.5 mg/dl, normoglycaemic glycosuria and metabolic acidemia (pH 7.30, HCO3\u2212 17.4 mmol/l) (Table ). Bilateral transcervical fractures were confirmed by MRI (Fig. ) and bone scintigraphy showed multiple hot spots in her joints and ribs, compatible with osteomalacia (Fig. ). Hypophosphatemic osteomalacia was diagnosed clinically from a low serum level of phosphorus, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (11.0 pg/dl), high levels of bone specific alkaline phosphatase (67.5 IU/l), and the findings of bone scintigram, although a bone biopsy was not performed. Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) was ruled out by total body survey with whole body computed tomography or endoscopic surveillances and a normal blood FGF23 (22.1 pg/ml, 10\u201350 pg/ml) level.\nUrinalysis showed pH 6.0 and twenty four hour urine demonstrated a low renal fractional tubular reabsorption of phosphate (Tmp/GFR 0.91), increased fractional excretion of uric acid (FEUA 43.9 %) and generalized aminoaciduria.\nThe calculated anion gap was 12.4 meq/l, with an inappropriately alkaline urine (pH 6.0), suggestive of distal type of renal tubular acidosis (RTA). An intravenous bicarbonate loading test to assess the tubular dysfunction demonstrated that the increased fractional excretion of bicarbonate (FEHCO3\u2212 13.25 %) and urine-blood (UB) Pco2 gradient (U-Bpco2 50.1 mmHg), suggesting the presence of proximal type of RTA. NH4Cl loading test was not performed because of the presence of apparent metabolic acidemia. These biochemical data of blood and urine indicated Fanconi syndrome with proximal type of RTA. Tests for anti-SSA and anti-SSB were negative and serum angiotensin converting enzyme levels were normal. Furthermore, serum and urine immunoelectrophoresis revealed no monoclonal component. Any of the patient\u2019s medication did not seem to be related to Fanconi syndrome. Light microscopic examination of a kidney biopsy demonstrated cellular infiltration of interstitium and proximal tubular epithelium composed mainly of CD3+ lymphocytes without glomerular involvement, consistent with features of TIN (Fig. ,).\nThe patient was also suspected to be diagnosed as PBC because of high levels of alkaline phosphatase (663 IU/l), high serum IgM levels (1084 mg/dl) and the presence of anti-mitochondrial M2 antibody (1:10). Sequential liver biopsy demonstrated the presence of a periportal cellular infiltrate (Fig. ), compatible with PBC though biochemical liver function was normal. The combination of these findings led to the patient\u2019s diagnosis of osteomalacia caused by TIN with Fanconi syndrome in asymptomatic PBC.\nThe patient was started on therapy with calcitriol (1 \u03bcg/day), neutral potassium phosphate and sodium bicarbonate (6 g/day). She was subsequently administered middle-dose corticosteroid (20 mg/day of predonisolone) and ursodeoxycholic acid (300 mg/day).

The contrast-enhanced CT showed multiple space-occupying lesions in the spleen, mottled low-density lesions, multiple hypoattenuating nodules with no contrast enhancement on the arterious phase. Delayed contrast-enhanced helical CT scan displayed incomplete filling of hypodense splenic lesions.

The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.\nThe patient is 32 years old. The patient's gender is Female, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.012.\nThe concentration of Serum Creatinine is 42.0 \u00b5mol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Serum Creatinine from \u00b5mol to mg. The mass of Serum Creatinine is 42.0 \u00b5mol.

To convert 0.005 g of Serum Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.005 g Serum Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 5.0 mg Serum Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 5.0 mg Serum Creatinine/10.0 dL = 0.5 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 42.0 \u00b5mol Serum Creatinine/L converts to 0.5 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. Because the patient's gender is female and the creatinine concentration is less than or equal to 0.7 mg/dL, A = 0.7 and B = -0.241.\nPlugging in these values, we get 142 * (0.5/0.7)**-0.241 * 0.9938**32 * 1.012 = 127.718.\nHence, the GFR value is 127.718 ml/min/1.73 m\u00b2.", "Result": "Incorrect"}

Further examination revealed prolapse of the anterior leaflet and rupture of the chordae tendineae. Baseline serum creatinine level was 102.5 \u03bcmol/L, and hemoglobin level was 12.6 g/dL. He underwent surgery for chordal replacement with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene chordae tendineae. And mitral annuloplasty was performed with a flexible annuloplasty Medtronic Duran ring. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography and postoperative transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated no residual mitral regurgitation. The patient was discharged in good condition one week after surgery. At the time of discharge, serum creatinine level was 87.5 \u03bcmol/L.\nSeven weeks after surgery he presented with anemia and \u201cdark urine\u201d and was admitted to our hospital. Investigations showed haemoglobin 4.5 g/dL, hematocrit 12%, undetectable haptoglobin, reticulocyte count 9%, slightly depressed platelet count 75,000/\u03bcL, serum lactic dehydrogenase 3600 IU/L, and total bilirubin of 69.86 \u03bcmol/L (indirect of 57.1 \u03bcmol/L). Peripheral blood smear demonstrated mechanical hemolysis with schistocytosis and red cell fragmentation (Fig. ). Creatinine levels ranged from256 to 362 \u03bcmol/L. Coomb\u2019s test, Ham test and sugar water test were negative. Expression of CD55 and CD59 for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria was normal. Drug-induced hemolytic anemia was not apparent, because there was no reduction of hemolysis after stopping the administration of any drug. On transthoracic echocardiography, mitral valve jet was found and judged to be mild, originating from the centre of the valve and striking the annuloplasty ring (Fig. ). The velocity of the mitral regurgitation jet was 2.3 m/s. The investigation did not show any evidence of a structural defect of the valve or the annuloplasty ring. Predonisolone for the possible microangiopathy was used. Three times of plasmapheresis and blood transfusion of 15 units red blood cells were required. After these treatments, the anemia and dark urine did not improve, with a creatinine level at 256 \u03bcmol/L. Based on previous experience with hemolytic patients following MVR and useless of aggressive conservative therapy, we decided to do reoperation for intracardiac inspection and mitral valve replacement after a detailed communication with the patient, despite RF. During the intraoperative inspection, there was no ring dehiscence or suture-related tear of the valve tissue. The annuloplasty ring was well endothelialized. Chordal attachments were intact. However, the new artificial chordae tendinae was completely non-endothelialized (Fig. ). The plasty ring was excised and the mitral valve was replaced with a 27-mm bileaflet prosthesis (Edwards Lifesciences). The hemolytic anemia resolved gradually after the reoperation. But the RF persisted after surgery and the patient was transferred to the department of hematology for hemodialysis. Three months later, the LDH level gradually fell to 224 U/L.

Prior to this, the patient had had a 6-month history of lower urinary tract symptoms for which his primary medical doctor had prescribed an \u03b11 receptor antagonist at a dose of 0.4 mg orally once daily. This initially brought about brief mild improvement in the patient\u2019s symptoms, but ultimately there was an increase in lower urinary tract symptoms. The patient denied renal colic, flank pain, or any constitutional symptoms. He had not suffered any recurrent urinary tract infections in the past and denied taking any anticoagulants other than two aspirin occasionally for headache.\nOn presentation to the urology clinic, the patient was found to have severe obstructive urinary symptoms. Rectal examination revealed a grossly abnormal prostate gland with nodularity throughout the entire palpable surface. Laboratory information showed a prostate serum antigen of 20.2 ng/mL. His most recently documented prostate serum antigen was 8.5 ng/mL, which was from one year previously. Baseline blood urea nitrogen/creatinine was 32/0.87. Because the patient had obstructive symptoms and a post void residual of 319 mL, a Foley catheter was placed and he was scheduled for a cystoscopy (as part of the hematuria workup)/voiding trial. He was also put on silodosin 8 mg per day orally and ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days. Upon the patient\u2019s return to the office, his Foley catheter was draining adequately. Post void residual was 600 mL. Cystoscopy showed a large amount of clot in the base of the bladder, which was irrigated to clear, and no active bleeding was noted. Significant distortion and posterior impingement of the trigone was noted, left hemitrigone being greater than the right. No diverticulum or stones were noted. Prostatic urethra showed a near visually obstructing prostate but no intraluminal filling defects of the bladder. A computed tomography (CT) urogram showed left hydronephrosis down to the trigone and some mild nonspecific adenopathy. Urine culture and sensitivity was positive for a Proteus urinary tract infection. The patient was already on ciprofloxacin (which was shown to be sensitive) and responding to treatment. Bicalutamide 50 mg orally once daily and finasteride 5 mg orally once daily were prescribed.\nThe patient underwent transrectal ultrasound and sampling of the prostate gland. It was noted that the patient\u2019s prostatic volume was 14.6 cc. Due to the patient\u2019s age, gross hematuria, and comorbid conditions, a limited six-core prostate biopsy was performed. Biopsy showed six of six cores positive for an adenocarcinoma Gleason grade 9 (5+4) prostate cancer (see ). CT scan and bone scan did not show any evidence of metastatic spread. The patient was diagnosed with clinical stage T2cN0M0 prostate cancer. The patient completed and passed a voiding trial. Bicalutamide, silodosin, and finasteride were continued. A depot suspension of leuprolide acetate (30 mg intramuscularly every four months) was started. Calcium and vitamin D were added for additional support (entirely prophylactic, given that the patient had no vitamin deficits prior to starting leuprolide). At this stage in the patient\u2019s clinical course, his urinalysis was normal and his post void residual was down to 67 mL. The patient was counseled on the management options and chose intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) as treatment for his prostate cancer.\nFiduciary gold seed markers were placed. The patient underwent a planning CT scan which was fused with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The prostate and seminal vesicles were contoured with a planning CT scan, expanded into planning target volumes, and a radiation plan was developed. The patient received 46 treatments over 64 days for a total dose of 8,280 cGy. Phase 1 (planning target volume 1) consisted of the prostate, seminal vesicles, and regional lymph nodes receiving 4,500 cGy in 180 cGy daily fractions. Phase 2 (planning target volume 2) consisted of the prostate alone receiving 3,780 cGy in 180 cGy daily doses. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy using an image-guided linear accelerator (Varian Instruments Inc, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was utilized to minimize both acute side effects and long-term sequelae. The patient tolerated his treatments well. Mild urinary symptoms were experienced, but his urination had been improving and his international prostate symptom score was <15 (9). Therefore, the patient did not require any additional medications and we felt that any surgical intervention (such as transurethral resection of the prostate) for symptomatic relief was not warranted at this time. The patient did develop some bowel symptoms that required a change in diet.\nThe patient was examined by his urologist post radiation therapy and was clinically doing well. He had a post void residual of 104 mL and a significantly reduced prostate serum antigen of 0.4 ng/mL. Repeat renal and bladder ultrasound showed resolution of his previously noted left hydronephrosis. However, just after intensity-modulated radiation therapy ended, the patient began to experience right lower extremity weakness and intermittent numbness from the mid calf distally. The patient had not experienced any falls or trauma. His serum glucose was under control throughout his entire evaluation (prior to treatment it was noted to be 122 mg/dL and then post treatment measured 88 mg/dL). This progressed to require an evaluation by a neurologist. Physical examination showed a mild wide-based stance with decreased stride length and a tendency to circumduct the right lower extremity, with mild to moderate right foot-drop. Initial evaluation included a lumbar puncture, comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood count, urinalysis, positron emission tomography scan, renal ultrasound, and CT scans of the head and spine. All initial studies were negative. Further evaluation included an electromyogram, as well as an MRI scan of the brain/cervical and thoracic spines. MRI of the brain specifically showed only mild diffuse cortical atrophy. The cervical and thoracic spine MRI scans showed a T2 hyperintensity spanning the lateral cortical spinal tracts of the entire cervical and thoracic cords.\nBlood work was collected locally, sent to the Mayo Clinic, and profiled in their paraneoplastic autoantibody evaluation. The profile was consistent with organ-specific neurologic autoimmunity, which suggested an association with multifocal neurologic mainfestations. Specifically, the blood work revealed a positive neuronal voltage-gated potassium channel antibody. These findings combined with MRI of the spine led the neurologist to diagnose the patient with a paraneoplastic syndrome. Magnetic resonance neurography was not done. The patient\u2019s nerve pain was based solely on his personal perspective. The patient was given an ankle-foot orthosis and a cane for ambulation, was started on intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, and referred for home-based physical therapy. At this time, the patient felt that both his strength and ambulation had improved, and his physical therapist agreed.

The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.\nThe patient is 70 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0.\nThe concentration of Serum Creatinine is 134.0 \u00b5mol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Serum Creatinine from \u00b5mol to mg. The mass of Serum Creatinine is 134.0 \u00b5mol. To convert 134.0 \u00b5mol of Serum Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 134.0 \u00b5mol Serum Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/\u00b5mol = 0.000134 mol Serum Creatinine. To convert from mol Serum Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.000134 mol Serum Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.015 g Serum Creatinine. To convert 0.015 g of Serum Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.015 g Serum Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 15.0 mg Serum Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 15.0 mg Serum Creatinine/10.0 dL = 1.5 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 134.0 \u00b5mol Serum Creatinine/L converts to 1.5 mg Serum Creatinine/dL.

Her history was notable for a background history of congenital biliary atresia (BA). She had undergone an early Kasai portoenterostomy with Roux-en-Y anastomosis in the early neonatal period. Her subsequent postoperative course was complicated by two episodes of cholangitis. By the age of two she had developed portal hypertension resulting in secondary thrombocytopenia due to hypersplenism. She had developed esophageal varices requiring annual sclerotherapy until the age of sixteen when she underwent variceal banding. Her vaccinations were up-to-date.\nGeneral findings on presentation at 11 weeks revealed icterus with scattered spider naevi. On abdominal inspection there was an upper abdominal scar from her prior surgery and on palpation the spleen was enlarged extending to below the level of the umbilicus; there was no evidence of ascites.\nAn ultrasound confirmed her estimated date of delivery. She was referred to the medical clinic at the hospital to provide a multidisciplinary team input to her care.\nAt sixteen weeks she developed an episode of cholangitis and she was treated with intravenous antibiotics for seven days. A liver ultrasound was performed. This revealed absence of intrahepatic dilatation with multiple periportal and peripancreatic varices and 14 cm splenomegaly. During the pregnancy her platelets remained low (29\u201355 \u00d7 109 L) and hemoglobin ranged from 8.8 to 10.5 g/dL. Her transaminases were marginally elevated (AST/ALT, 46/67) and coagulation parameters were normal. Significant concern remained about her thrombocytopenia and degree of hypersplenism.\nA multidisciplinary meeting was convened with hepatology, hepatobiliary surgery, and interventional radiology. Concerns for this patient included her significant splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia, risk of recurrent cholangitis, potential for massive variceal hemorrhage, and potential for preterm delivery, either spontaneous or iatrogenic. Abdominal delivery would also be compromised by large venous anastomoses in the anterior abdominal wall. A plan for management of gastrointestinal hemorrhage was outlined. Further imaging of her portal vessels was recommended as this would inform the interventional radiologists as to which was the optimum surgical intervention should bleeding develop from intraabdominal varices. The option of a splenectomy in pregnancy was excluded as this was deemed likely to cause portal vein thrombosis and would compromise any future candidacy for liver transplantation. At twenty weeks she underwent MR venography of the portal vessels. Her spleen measured 23 cm, there was evidence of extensive splenic and esophageal varices, and no lienorenal shunt was identified.\nShe had bimonthly antenatal visits with her obstetrical and hepatology teams. Her anatomy scan was within normal limits with a well-grown fetus on the 31st centile. Due to the complexity of the case and the potential for preterm delivery she received two doses of betamethasone at twenty-six weeks of gestation to aid lung maturation.\nAt 26+3 she presented to the maternity hospital with vaginal bleeding, suprapubic pressure, and uterine contractions for 24 hours with increasing intensity and duration. The fundal height was consistent with 26 weeks of pregnancy and cardiotocography was reassuring. Sterile speculum examination confirmed that the cervix was 5 cm dilated and fully effaced and the amniotic membranes were bulging through the cervix. A bedside ultrasound scan confirmed a breech presentation. Her platelet count was 33 \u00d7 109/L. Following consultation with perioperative medicine, the hepatobiliary team, and neonatology the decision was made to perform an emergency caesarean section. It had been planned to perform her surgery in a general hospital; however, due to the acute nature of her presentation the caesarean section was undertaken in the obstetric facility, with hepatobiliary surgery and interventional radiology on standby in the general hospital. Pooled platelets were administered immediately prior to surgery. Magnesium sulphate was administered to provide fetal neuroprotection. The caesarean section was performed via a vertical subumbilical incision, with a lower segment transverse incision on the uterus. The vertical incision was utilized both to provide greater access to the abdominal cavity should bleeding occur, either from the uterus or the varices, and to avoid large venous collaterals running vertically in the abdominal wall. A live male baby was delivered by breech extraction and transferred to the pediatric team following delayed cord clamping of 45 seconds. Apgar's scores were 61, 65, and 710; the cord blood gases were pH 7.27 (arterial) 7.29 (venous). The infant weighed 890 grams. The remainder of the surgery was uneventful. Perioperatively she received a further pooled platelet transfusion with good hemostasis and no transfusion of packed red cells was required. Her baby was transferred to intensive care and initially required CPAP. He had an uncomplicated neonatal course. Histology of the placenta was unremarkable. The patient had an uneventful postpartum course. She was advised against further pregnancies in view of her significant risks and underwent insertion of a levonorgestrel coil at three months postpartum for contraceptive purposes and she is currently awaiting liver transplantation.

To stabilize the patient a total of eight packs of red blood cells were transfused.\nIn preparation of cardiac surgery, a coronary angiogram was performed (). It revealed active leakage of contrast agent in the proximal circumflex artery and the patient was transferred to the cardiac surgery department immediately. Intra-operatively a perforation of the tissue at the basis of the LAA close to the left main coronary artery was discovered. Under protection of cold blood cardioplegia on cardiopulmonary bypass the occluder was excised through the opened left atrium.

He had truncal obesity, a \"moon face\" and proximal muscle weakness. An electrocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy. His laboratory work-up revealed anaemia (Hb 10.7 g/dl), hypokaliemia (3.4 mEq/L), metabolic alkalosis (HCO3- 35 mmol/L) and hyperglycaemia (170 mg/dl). A CT scan of thorax and abdomen demonstrated a dissection starting just below left succlavian artery and extending downward to the left renal artery, involving the celiac tripod and superior mesenteric artery (). The dissection was classified as Stanford B, De Bakey III. Moreover CT scan of abdomen revealed incidentally a left adrenal tumour of 25 mm of diameter.\nThe patient was pharmacologically treated and was felt at risk for impending aortic rupture. Therefore, an emergent endograft positioning was planned. Our goal was to exclude the damaged segment of the aorta and to obliterate the entry of blood into the false lumen (both at the initial intimal tear and at the secondary tears along the vessel). Through an inguinal incision, the right common, superficial and profunda femoral artery were dissected free. A prosthetic graft (Valiant, Medtronic, Sunnyvale, CA, USA 42 mm x 198 mm) was placed just below the origin of the left succlavian artery up to the diaphragmatic hiatus. A postoperative control CT scan demonstrated the correct graft positioning, not endoleaks and the closure of all secondary tears ().\nThis patient was evaluated for hypercortisolism and the plasma cortisol was increased to 33.9 \u03bcg/dl (vn, value of normal, 5.6-23 \u03bcg/dl) without circadian rhythm and not suppressed by the administration of 1 mg of dexamethasone (overnight text: 9.8 \u03bcg/dl; vn <1.8 \u03bcg/dl ).

The patient had a medical history of well-controlled diabetes mellitus and hypertension that was being treated with an angiotensin receptor blocker, a calcium channel blocker, and a beta blocker. The body mass index was 33.8, but he had no respiratory symptoms, including sleep apnea. A preoperative chest X-ray showed mild cardiomegaly but electrocardiography and echocardiogram findings were normal. The patient's symptoms were amnesia, gait disturbance, and urinary incontinence that had persisted for 5 months; preoperatively, he was alert and cooperative and had no problem communicating. The preoperative vital signs were: blood pressure, 110/70 mmHg; heart rate, 59 beats/min; respiratory rate, 18 breaths/min; and oxygen saturation, 96%. Since the appearance of the patient suggested a possible difficult intubation, a video laryngoscope was used for tracheal intubation after induction of general anesthesia with 150 mg propofol 1%, 40 mg lidocaine 2%, and 60 mg rocuronium. The vocal cord was clearly visible on the video laryngoscope and the intubation was accomplished without trauma or other difficulties. Anesthesia was maintained with 5% desflurane and 0.02 \u00b5g/kg/min remifentanil, and air with 50% oxygen. The surgery lasted 2 hours and required no additional muscle relaxants. During the surgery, there was sudden and sustained hypotension (mean blood pressure 52\u201357 mmHg) with bradycardia (heart rate 45\u201355 beats/min) that did not respond well to ephedrine; these complications began about 10 min after the beginning of the surgery and lasted for 25 min until a dopamine infusion was administered that restored normal blood pressure. Remifentanil infusion was discontinued at the onset of hypotension and bradycardia. After the purge of volatile agents at the end of the surgery, the train of four (TOF) count was 4, and the ratio was 50%, so 2 mg/kg of sugammadex was injected. The patient recovered muscle power within a few minutes, showing firm hand grip, head elevation, and mouth opening, and was fully obeying verbal commands, but was not opening his eyes. As he was alert and cooperative at that point and no other neurologic deficit was observed, the neurosurgeons thought that the inability to open his eyes was not related to the surgery. We relieved the bandage on the head in order to reduce the chance of unintended pressure or tension on the forehead, and suggested that further neurologic examinations be done after full recovery from anesthesia. Spontaneous respiration was present, showing expired tidal volumes reaching 500 ml each time, but was tachypneic; the patient's respiratory rate ranged from 40 to 50 breaths/min. This condition continued for 5 min, at which time the patient was extubated and transferred to the PACU under mask ventilation. The patient showed signs of inspiratory stridor, chest retractions, and hoarse voice after the extubation. The patient's accessory respiratory muscles were not involved in the hyperventilation. There was no crackle or wheezing clear on auscultation besides the inspiratory stridor, but the findings were not clear on account of the hoarse voice and the rapid and dynamic ventilation. An additional 2 mg/kg of sugammadex was injected in the PACU under the theory that the patient's upper airway was obstructed because of possible residual paralysis but the condition did not change. The patient was fully responsive to verbal commands but was still unable to open his eyes or hold his breath and he complained of feeling like he was choking despite the hyperventilation. Arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) at that point showed: pH, 7.35; pCO2, 37 mmHg; pO2, 76 mmHg; HCO3, 20.4 mmol/L; and O2 saturation, 94%. The vital signs at that point were: blood pressure, 150/90 mmHg; heart rate, 110 beats/min; and respiratory rate, 44 breaths/min. Since tachypnea (40\u201350 breaths/min) persisted for 20 min in the PACU and oxygen saturation started to drop under 95%, 200 mg thiopental sodium and 100 mg succinylcholine were injected and endotracheal intubation was performed. Endotracheal suction was done immediately after intubation and there was no sputum or discharge. Auscultation right after the re-intubation sounded smooth, without crackle or wheezing, and the oxygen saturation rapidly corrected to 100%. Tachypnea persisted even under sedation after the succinylcholine wore off, so a central cause was suspected. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a massive pneumocephalus with pneumoventricle and hydrocephalus (). A chest X-ray taken after the brain CT showed no pathologic findings such as pulmonary edema, congestion, or pneumothorax. On the neurosurgeon's recommendation, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and was kept there for three days under mechanical ventilation with sedation with midazolam, cisatracurium, and rocuronium until the pneumocephalus and tachypnea spontaneously resolved. Follow-up chest radiographs were taken over the next 3 weeks and showed nothing abnormal. According to a pulmonology consultation, the tachypnea was not likely to have originated from pulmonary problems. ABGA results stayed within normal limits under fully controlled mechanical ventilation but showed hypoxemia when the patient gained spontaneous respiration during the sedative period before the resolution of the pneumocephalus. Since the follow-up chest X-rays showed no abnormal findings, pulmonary embolism evaluation including embolism CT and laboratory examinations, which also showed nothing abnormal, were done on the recommendation of a pulmonologist. When a follow-up brain CT showed resolution of the pneumocephalus on the 3rd day after the surgery, sedative and neuromuscular blocking agents were discontinued and the mechanical ventilation mode was switched to synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation. The respiratory rate at that point ranged from 15 to 20 breaths/min and ABGA results remained normal when the patient gained consciousness and self-respiration, so the endotracheal tube was extubated.

{"Row Number": 56, "Calculator Name": "CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk", "Calculator ID": "4", "Note ID": "pmc-4157480-1", "Patient Note": "A 62-year-old male presented to Samsung Medical Center with a 40-year history of paroxysmal palpitations. Although diagnosed with atrial septal defect (ASD) 30 years previously, the patient elected not to undergo surgical repair. Approximately 1 year prior, he began to visit the pediatric ward of Samsung Medical Center more frequently with symptoms of palpitations and dyspnea lasting 2 to 3 days and occurring in 2- to 3-month intervals. An electrocardiogram showed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and secundum-type ASD (22.3 mm) with a left-to-right shunt was diagnosed by echocardiogram. Device closure (Amplatzer septal occlude 28 mm; AGA Medical, Golden Valley, MN, USA) was then performed; however, 1 week after the procedure, the patient continued to experience dyspnea and chest pain after 10 to 20 minutes of walking. Sustained atrial fibrillation was seen on the electrocardiogram and 24-hour Holter monitor. Cardioversion was performed following hospitalization with the opinion that the persistent atrial fibrillation was due to device closure. The patient was discharged from the hospital after cardioversion to sinus rhythm at 100 J; however, the symptoms recurred. Since it was difficult to perform radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) due to the recent device closure, the patient was referred to the thoracic surgery department for totally thoracoscopic ablation. Surgery was performed under routine procedures. Intubation was performed using a double lumen endotracheal tube. For the surgery, a 10-mm trocar was inserted in the fourth intercostal space (ICS) of the right anterior axillary line, a 5-mm trocar in the third ICS along the anterior axillary line, and a 10-mm trocar in the sixth ICS on the mid-axillary line. Right pulmonary vein ablation, right ganglionated plexi ablation, and ablation of the right half of the space between the right lower pulmonary vein and the left lower pulmonary vein were performed. Between the procedures, we conducted a high-frequency stimulation test for finding ganglionated plexi. Sutures were placed after chest tube insertion. On the left side, ports were placed in the same positions, and ablations were performed in the same order as on the right side after dividing Marshall\u2019s ligament (). A left atrial auricle resection was then performed using an Echelon Flex 60 articulating endoscopic linear cutter (Ethicon Endo-Surgery Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA). Upon confirmation of the conversion to sinus rhythm, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. He was then transferred to the general ward on postoperative day 1 and discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 6. During this 6-day postoperative period, the sinus rhythm was maintained continuously. Six months later, the sinus rhythm was seen on the 24-hour Holter monitor; the patient showed none of the earlier symptoms, and therefore, amiodarone and warfarin were stopped. The patient is currently being followed as an outpatient, and his sinus rhythm has been well maintained as seen on the last electrocardiogram at the 8 month follow-up.", "Question": "What is the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score?", "LLM Answer": "2", "LLM Explanation": "The CHA2DS2-VASc score is used to calculate the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation and can help determine whether anticoagulant therapy is appropriate.
