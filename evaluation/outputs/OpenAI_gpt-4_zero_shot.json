Serologic tests were all negative for hepatitis A, B, C, and E. Computed tomography (CT) performed at admission revealed no distinct nodules or masses in the liver, but mild splenomegaly, multiple hypodense splenic lesions, and para-aortic lymph node swelling (Fig. a\u2013c). Antibiotics were administered intravenously for suspected acute cholangitis and sepsis, but the fever persisted. Abdominal ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed 2 days later newly depicted gallbladder wall thickening and ascites (Figs. , ). On the same night, the patient presented with grade II hepatic encephalopathy, with blood tests showing a decrease in platelet count and worsening liver function suggestive of \u201cacute type\u201d ALF with hepatic coma and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). While consideration was being given to treating acute liver failure, the patient suddenly developed ventricular fibrillation and died despite immediate resuscitation measures on day 3 of hospitalization.\nGiven the rapid clinical course, an autopsy was performed in this patient with suspected ALF likely due to drug-induced liver injury, autoimmune hepatitis, hepatitis of indeterminate etiology, circulatory disturbance, metabolic disease, or malignant cells including malignant lymphoma. This led to the patient being diagnosed with malignant, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, characterized by multiple lymph-node, as well as multi-organ (i.e., spleen, liver, lung, and prostate) involvement: (1) general swelling of lymph nodes in the para-abdominal aorta (Fig. a), peripancreatic, peribronchial, pulmonary hilar, subclavicular regions, as well as in the pelvis, especially around the iliac arteries, measuring up to 60 mm in diameter; (2) presence of multiple whitish splenic nodules (Fig. b) with the entire spleen shown to be microscopically infiltrated by tumor cells (Fig. a); (3) irregular geographical morphology of the liver (Fig. c) with the lymphoma cells mainly infiltrating the portal areas (Fig. b); (4) involvement of the right lobe of the lung; (5) involvement of both lobes of the prostate consequent to outer connective tissue involvement (Fig. c). Microscopically, the tumor cells in the lymph nodes were shown to have medium-sized irregular nuclei and small nucleoli with a high nuclear cytoplasmic ratio, thus showing diffuse proliferation characterized by the presence of large numbers of small T-cells (Fig. ). Immunohistochemistry revealed the tumor cells to be positive for CD20 (Fig. a), CD79a (Fig. b), bcl-2 (Fig. c), and MUM1 (Fig. d), but negative for CD3 (Fig. e), CD10, bcl-6, and cyclin D1, with a Ki-67 labeling index (Ki-67 LI) of 16% (Fig. f).

The patient states he has had chest discomfort and food intolerance for the past week, but that his symptoms were far worse tonight. He notes no inciting event, recent trauma, or aggravating factors. On exam he appears uncomfortable, anxious, and is in a semi-tripod position. Vitals are pertinent for a heart rate of 144, systolic blood pressure in the 180 s, and oxygen saturation of 89% on 1L O2 via nasal cannula. Of note, the patient weighed 67.2 kg, and was 173 cm tall. Chart review showed that he had lost approximately 4 kg (last recorded weight in chart was 71.2 kg), since his last medical visit.\nPrimary survey was overall unremarkable. Airway was secure, patient\u2019s breathing improved with 3 L oxygen, breath sounds were present and equal bilaterally, vascular access was obtained, and GCS was 15. Intravenous pain medication was given which improved the patient\u2019s blood pressure to systolic 140 s. Given this patient\u2019s overall clinical picture, the most pressing disease processes included myocardial infarction (given history of coronary artery disease and prior infarcts), aortic dissection (given symptoms, hypertension, and medical history), pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism (the previous two diagnoses given his chest pain and decreased O2 even on 1 L of oxygen), and cardiac wall rupture (given multiple prior MIs). Other considerations include congestive heart failure, hypertensive crisis, and an underlying infection.\nLabs were drawn to include a CBC, renal panel, cardiac panel, lactate, and a type and cross. EKG was unremarkable. A chest X-ray was obtained which revealed a widened mediastinum (Fig. ).\nThe patient was stabilized, but the underlying cause of his symptoms had not yet been identified. His widened mediastinum is troubling, and further drives the differential. Aortic (dissection, aneurysm), cardiac (tamponade, wall rupture), and esophageal pathology (rupture versus other masses) now move to the top of the list of diagnoses. Labs continued to be pending. Given his now overall hemodynamically stable status and clinical improvement, the decision was made to obtain a CT chest/abdomen/pelvis which revealed the following (Fig. ).\nAlong with the CT scan; the initial set of labs resulted and were pertinent for leukocytosis (white blood cell count/WBC) of 19,000/mcL, creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, lactate of 3.94 mmol/L, and troponin of 0.101 ng/mL. Although no official read of the images were immediately available, a preliminary read by the team was concerning for mega-esophagus versus a strangulated hiatal hernia. Treatment of the pathology to limit the degree of heart strain (increased troponin), ischemia (as evidenced by the WBC and lactate), and possibility for future perforation were now the primary goals. Night Hawk radiology was contacted for an emergent read, who stated that the images were consistent with a severely dilated esophagus. No pulmonary emboli were visualized, and no other acute abnormalities were reported.\nThe findings, treatment modalities, risks, and benefits were discussed in depth with the patient. Given his dilated esophagus which was severe enough to cause him chest pain, dyspnea, alter his vitals, elevate his WBC, elevate lactate levels, and cause heart strain. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with possible video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), possible thoracotomy, possible laparoscopy, and possible laparotomy were recommended to the patient. The goal was for direct visualization of area, decompression, and repair of any defects. The patient was in full agreement with the plan, and was taken to the operating room shortly thereafter. In the mean time, given the location of the pathology and concern for developing septic picture, the patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and an antifungal.\nOn EGD, the patient\u2019s esophageal distention was found to be from a large bezoar which spanned from the broncho-aortic region of the esophagus to his lower esophageal sphincter. The bezoar was a phytobezoar, with evidence of medication and food particles (meat, vegetables) incorporated into it. The esophageal tissue appeared tenuous and appeared to be the cause of the patient\u2019s lab derangements (Fig. ).\nThe decompression was done carefully and meticulously by fragmenting the bezoar endoscopically using a snare device. About 2 h into the procedure, a repeat set of labs were drawn which showed significant improvement in his labs showing a WBC of now 7600/mcL (from 19,000/mcL), creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL (from 1.4 mg/dL), lactate of 0.86 mmol/L (from 3.94 mmol/L), and a troponin of 0.046 ng/mL (from 0.101 ng/mL). A discussion between the surgical team, anesthesia, and gastroenterology (via telephone) was done in the operating room for planning. Given his hemodynamic stability, improving lab values, and previous CT scan which showed no gross evidence of a leak, the decision was made to end the procedure for further resuscitation with plans to return to the OR for interval endoscopy to re-assess the esophagus. In the meantime, the patient was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics (to include antifungal coverage). He was kept Nil per os (NPO) and was admitted to the intensive care unit.\nThe patient remained hemodynamically normal and clinically stable throughout the night. The multi-disciplinary team determined the best course of action to be complete bezoar debridement, placement of NG tube, nutrition and medical optimization, workup for possible underlying esophageal pathology (to include completion EGD, manometry, and pH probe), and eventual endoscopic versus surgical management of determined condition. The above was again relayed to the patient and his family who fully supported the plan. The bezoar debridement was completed, and the esophagus was inspected for luminal integrity. An NG tube was able to be carefully placed under direct visualization.\nThe patient did well and was eventually able to be downgraded to the regular surgical floor. During his stay, a gastrostomy tube was obtained for feeding access and nutritional optimization. He would undergo several follow-up EGDs during his hospitalization to completely clear the bezoar and assess the esophageal lumen (Figs. and ). After discharge, the patient was further worked up and was found to have achalasia and esophagitis. Thorough workup includes a barium swallow study (patient\u2019s barium swallow shown in Fig. ), EGD, manometry, pH study, and a chest CT (for, among other things, surgical planning).

She had poliomyelitis when she was very young, and there was nothing special regarding her family or psychosocial history. Serology was positive for perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA) and negative for anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA). Her condition was refractory to steroids and complicated by Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Ultimately, she underwent sub-total colectomy and ileostomy in February 2015. Pathological examination of the resection specimen showed diffuse pan-colitis consistent with UC and no indications of Crohn\u2019s disease (Fig. ). She did well in the following 11 months; prednisone was tapered and stopped within 2 months, and she gained 5 kg of weight after the ileostomy. In January 2016, a scheduled restorative ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) with proximal neo-ileostomy was performed.\nFrom one month after the IPAA, her 24-h stool collection slowly increased to 1.5\u20132 L. Next, she noticed decreased urine output since April. In early May 2016, she presented to our emergency room with repeated unconsciousness over the course of 10 days. Her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure (BP), 74/50 mmHg; heart rate (HR), 90 bpm; additionally, she exhibited a poor nutritional status (160 cm; 39 kg). On physical examination, active bowel sounds were noticed to occur approximately 7\u20139 times per minute. Her serum creatinine level was 183 \u03bcmol/L, indicating acute kidney injury. Treatment with fluid replacement and noradrenaline maintained her BP at 80\u201390/50\u201360 mmHg and gradually normalized her creatinine level. However, her 24-h watery stool collection persisted, and she developed fever and vomiting. While many leukocytes were found in stool collected from the diverted ileostomy, repeated stool cultures and tests for Clostridium difficile toxins were negative. Tests for CMV-DNA, CMV-pp65 and EBV-DNA were performed and were all negative. The patient was not on any medications, including NSAIDs, upon verification. Her treatment with steroids was stopped before the end of April 2015. Empirical treatment with antibiotics, including ceftazidime, metronidazole and oral vancomycin, was administered with no response. Due to her reliance on noradrenaline, relative adrenal insufficiency was suspected, and hydrocortisone was initiated at 50 mg q6 h intravenously. Her stool volume decreased to less than 500 ml per day quickly, by which time the treatment with noradrenaline was successfully stopped. The levels of D-lactate, endotoxin and diamine oxidase indicated that the barrier function of the intestine was compromised and that bacterial translocation may have occurred. Oedematous inflamed mucosa with patchy superficial ulcers was observed in the diverted pouch by pouchoscopy. Although an upper endoscopy and an endoscopy through a stoma revealed a normal gross appearance in the stomach, duodenum and pre-stomal ileum (Fig. a, b), the histological examination of tissue biopsies of both the duodenum and pre-stomal ileum revealed enteritis, as indicated by moderate villous atrophy, cryptitis, decreased goblet cells, and severe active inflammation with neutrophil infiltration in the lamina propria, as well as negativity for intraepithelial lymphocytosis (Fig. a-d). From these lines of evidence of histological enteritis presenting in the duodenum, pre-stomal ileum and diverted pouch, we considered pan-enteritis to be present, and we diagnosed the patient with post-colectomy enteritis. The patient was treated with methylprednisolone at 30 mg intravenously once a day with tapering by 5 mg every 7 to 10 days; however, her stool volume from the ileostomy still gradually increased to 3\u20134 L. After a multidisciplinary team discussion, ileostomy closure was debated as the final rescue treatment and was performed in August 2016. Two months later, her stool volume decreased to less than 1 L per day, and she gained 2.5 kg of weight. Azathioprine at 50 mg/d was prescribed during the tapering of prednisone. Until the last follow-up in March 2018, she performed well, with an increase in body weight to 50 kg, and daily defecation approximately 5\u20136 times at less than 1 L/day, sometimes with form (Additional file ). Gastroduodenal endoscopy and pouchoscopy were repeated annually and showed normal villi in the descending duodenum and neo-ileum in March 2018 (Fig. c, d).

We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of creatinine from \u00b5mol to mg. The mass of creatinine is 183.0 \u00b5mol. To convert 183.0 \u00b5mol of creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 183.0 \u00b5mol creatinine * 1e-06 mol/\u00b5mol = 0.000183 mol creatinine. To convert from mol creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.000183 mol creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.021 g creatinine.

Most notably, both creatinine and sodium were within normal levels, i.e. 0.7 mg/dL and 137 mEq/L, respectively. The patient had a history of encephalopathy during childhood of an unknown origin without sequelae, an elective caesarean section (1997) due to leiomyoma, laparoscopic myomectomy and removal of an endometrial cyst of the ovary (1999), and a second caesarean section (2000) due to an uterine instability subsequent to the first caesarean section and myomectomy.

The duration of the procedure was prolonged due to the reduced visibility caused by excessive bleeding and cervical leakage of distension medium, which impeded proper expansion of the uterine cavity. The ventilation pressure increased slowly and continuously 60 min subsequent to the start of surgery. The compliance of the lungs, as well as the achievable minute volume within the acceptable airway pressure limit of 2 kPa, decreased. It was presumed that the level of anaesthesia was insufficient and was followed by the increased administration of propofol (10 mg/kg/h). The additional inhalation of fenoterol did, however, not improve the situation. As ventilation continued to be difficult, the laryngeal mask was replaced by a 7.0 cm (inside diameter) cuffed tube subsequent to the administration of 100 mg succinylcholine as a muscle relaxant. Approximately 50 mL of a foamy, transparent liquid was aspirated from the trachea. Testing with litmus paper indicated an alkaline pH and, therefore, not the aspiration of gastric content. The amount of the pulmonary oedema increased and, despite high levels of peak airway pressures at this point approximately 3 kPa (= set peak pressure limit), adequate ventilation was not possible. Blood gas and electrolyte analyses indicated acidosis, as well as a severe hyponatremia (pH 7.11; Na 74 mEq/L; partial pressure of CO2 49.9 mmHg; saturation of O2 97 % at FiO2 1.0). Cardiopulmonary changes remained minimal. 40 mg of furosemide and 500 mL of 3 % NaCl solution were immediately administered at an infusion rate of 500 mL/h, with constant monitoring for electrolyte changes. As the patient showed clinical signs of impaired haemostasis, the operation procedure was stopped. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit with continuous administration of 3 % NaCl at a rate of 50 mL/h and electrolyte control. Plasma sodium levels increased from 74 mEq/L to 103 mEq/L after one hour, and to 130 mEq/L after 7 h (Fig. ). All together 800 mL of 3 % NaCl solution were administered within 7 h totalling at 24 g. Subsequently, sodium replenishment was stopped and the patient was extubated without problems. Immediate neurological assessment revealed no detectable deficits. 20 h after the onset of hyponatremia, the patient\u2019s sodium levels returned to within the normal range. Until then, the cumulative renal excretion was 8.5 L. 9 L of distension medium was used intraoperatively with a calculated uptake of 5 L. The patient was relocated to the gynaecologic ward the following day and was released from the hospital on the third postoperative day without any detectable sequelae.", "Question": "What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.", "LLM Answer": "72.76", "LLM Explanation": "no explanation", "Ground Truth Answer": "78.121", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.\nThe patient's gender is female, which means that the gender coefficient is 0.85.\nThe patient is 45 years old. \nThe concentration of creatinine is 0.7 mg/dL. \nThe formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.\nThe patient's height is 156.0 cm, which is 156.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.56 m. The patient's weight is 58.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 58.0 kg / (1.56 m * 1.56 m) = 23.833 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 23.8, indicating they are normal weight.\nBecause the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation.

{"Row Number": 6, "Calculator Name": "Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)", "Calculator ID": "2", "Note ID": "pmc-5526772-1", "Patient Note": "A 41-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our hospital with liver damage, itchy skin, and pyrexia. His medical history was unremarkable, but one year previously his gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels had risen to 271 IU/L (normal: < 30 IU/L). Prior to this, the patient had consumed 540 mL of sake three times a week, and he had been reducing the amount of alcohol he consumed for about one year. He did not smoke or take any recreational drugs. He was single, was not homosexual, and he had not had sexual intercourse for over one year.\nThe patient had undergone treatment of his internal hemorrhoids as an outpatient at a nearby hospital that comprised an aluminum potassium sulfate and tannic acid (ALTA) injection. He developed a fever of 38 \u00b0C, dark colored urine, and itchy skin on postoperative day (POD) 1, and he took loxoprofen sodium, as required. He consulted another doctor on POD 7, because the symptoms had not improved, and his blood test results led to a diagnosis of liver dysfunction. His liver dysfunction had not improved by POD 14, and he was admitted to our hospital on POD 15.\nThe patient was 167 cm tall and weighed 52.5 kg. He presented with a blood pressure of 103/59 mmHg, a heart rate of 82 beats per minute, a temperature of 36.6 \u00b0C, and 99% oxygen saturation in room air. No specific physical findings were evident during the clinical examination on the day of hospitalization, but the patient had a rash, edema, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and jaundice. The subjective symptoms, comprising the fever, dark colored urine, and itchy skin, had disappeared by POD 10.\nThe laboratory test results showed that the patient\u2019s complete blood count was almost normal with a white blood cell count of 6900 cells/\u03bcL, a hemoglobin concentration of 14.7 g/dL, a hematocrit level of 43.1%, and a platelet count of 3.98 \u00d7 105 cells/\u03bcL, but a higher percentage of eosinophils was present (6.8%) (normal: 1.0%-5.0%), which peaked at 13.9% on POD 20. The patient\u2019s serum liver enzyme and bilirubin levels were elevated at the time of admission. The aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level was 432 IU/L (normal: 10-40 IU/L), the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was 911 IU/L (normal: 10-40 IU/L), the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level was 473 IU/L (normal: 115-359 IU/L), and the total bilirubin level was 1.3 mg/dL (normal: 0.2-1.2 mg/dL). Thus, compared with the ALP level, the AST and ALT levels showed greater magnitudes of elevation. The patient\u2019s other blood test results were within the normal ranges, as follows: serum albumin: 4.0 g/dL (normal: 3.8-5.2 g/dL); serum creatinine: 0.86 mg/dL (normal: 0.65-1.09 mg/dL); C-reactive protein: 0.1 mg/dL (normal: 0-0.3 mg/dL); prothrombin time: 100% (normal: 80%-120 %); thyroid-stimulating hormone: 0.5 \u03bcIU/mL (normal: 0.34-4.04 \u03bcIU/mL); triiodothyronine: 2.98 pg/dL (normal: 2.36-5.00 pg/dL); and thyroxin: 1.18 ng/dL (normal: 0.88-1.67 ng/dL). The serological tests for autoantibodies generated weakly positive results (1:40) for anti-nuclear antibodies, and negative results for anti-smooth muscle and anti-mitochondrial antibodies. Negative results were obtained from the tests for the hepatitis B virus surface antigen, the hepatitis C virus antibody, rapid plasma reagin, the anti-Epstein-Barr virus immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody, and the anti-cytomegalovirus IgM antibody, and from the Treponema pallidum hemagglutination test. The IgG level was within the normal range at 1415 mg/dL (normal: 800-1600 mg/dL) and the IgM level was within the normal range at 100 mg/dL (normal: 60-250 mg/dL). The IgE level was elevated at 1333 mg/dL (normal: < 250 mg/dL). Chest radiography did not reveal any abnormalities. No morphological changes were evident following abdominal ultrasonography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, and abdominal computed tomography (Figure ).\nWhen the patient was hospitalized, we considered viral, alcohol-induced, autoimmune, drug-induced, biliary tract, and thyroid function-based diseases as frequent causes of acute liver dysfunction for the differential diagnosis, and, based on the patient\u2019s medical history, and the serological and imaging results, we considered that alcohol and DILI were highly likely causes of the patient\u2019s acute liver dysfunction. However, the patient had stopped drinking during the past year, so we thought that there was a high likelihood of DILI. Therefore, we began conservative treatment with a small amount of extracellular fluid replacement.\nFigure presents the patient\u2019s symptoms, laboratory test results, and treatment over the entire course. The liver transaminase and bilirubin levels decreased rapidly after admission, and the maximum levels were as follows: ALT: 950 IU/L on POD 15; AST: 470 IU/L on POD 17; and total bilirubin: 2.1 mg/dL on POD 17. The ALP and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels showed consistent downward trends from POD 7. The patient's symptoms disappeared on POD 10, and no new symptoms appeared after hospitalization. We performed a liver biopsy on POD 25, and a drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST) of the components of the ALTA injection and lidocaine on POD 28. The patient was discharged on POD 29, and he was managed as an outpatient without any prescriptions. At the time of the patient\u2019s first outpatient appointment on POD 35, his liver transaminase and bilirubin levels had declined and were almost within the normal ranges.\nFigure presents hematoxylin and eosin (H and E)-stained sections of the liver biopsy performed on POD 25. The H and E staining showed that the basic structure of the liver had been maintained without any hepatocyte dropout or disruption, and that the bile duct had not been disrupted. At a higher magnification, the H and E staining showed that the parenchymal cells were partially dilated and that a mild inflammatory cell infiltration was present in the area of the central vein. Neither eosinophil nor plasma cell infiltrations were detected within the liver tissue. Bile plugs were found at multiple sites within the parenchyma and sinusoids. Masson staining did not show the presence of liver tissue fibrosis.\nThe lymphocyte proliferation activity levels, which were determined from the DLST performed on POD 28, were 676 counts per minute (cpm) for the control and 871 cpm for the ALTA with lidocaine. The stimulation index, which was calculated as the ALTA with lidocaine cpm divided by the control cpm, was 1.29 (normal in Japanese people: < 1.8).", "Question": "What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?
