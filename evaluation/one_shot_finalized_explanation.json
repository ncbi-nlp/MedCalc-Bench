            "step_by_step_thinking": "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.\nThe patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.\nThe patient is 53 years old. \nThe concentration of creatinine is 1.39 mg/dL. \nThe formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.\nThe patient's height is 175 cm, which is 175 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.75 m. The patient's weight is 87.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 87.0 kg / (1.75 m * 1.75 m) = 28.40816 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 28.4, indicating they are overweight/obese.\nBecause the patient is overweight/obese, we use the adjusted body weight formula to get the adjusted weight used for Cockroft-Gault Equation. Shown below is the computation for IBW (ideal body weight).\nFor males, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows: IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60)\nFor females, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows: 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60)\nThe patient's gender is Male.\nThe patient's height is 175 cm, which is 175 cm * 0.393701 in/cm = 68.89768 in. \nPlugging in the values for the IBW formula for males gives us 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (68.89768 (in inches) - 60) = 70.46466 kg.\nHence, the patient's IBW is 70.46466 kg.Shown below is the computation for ABW (adjusted body weight).\nTo compute the ABW value, apply the following formula: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg)). ABW = 70.46466 kg + 0.4 * (87.0 kg  - 70.46466 kg) = 77.0788 kg. The patient's adjusted body weight is 77.0788 kg.\nUsing the Cockcroft-Gault equation:\nCrCl = ((140 - age) * weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).\nPlugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 53) * 77.0788 * 1) / (1.39 * 72) = 67.00495 mL/min. Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 67.00495 mL/min.",

        "Patient Note": "A 53-year old man (height, 175 cm; weight, 87 kg) was scheduled to undergo subtotal stomach-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy with portal vein reconstruction for pancreatic cancer after receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. Laparoscopic left nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma was performed 1 year prior; therefore, harvesting the left internal jugular vein for portal vein reconstruction was planned because the left renal vein was too short. Preoperative serum creatinine level and potassium level were 1.39 mg/dL and 4.1 mEq/L, respectively. General anesthesia was induced rapidly with propofol, rocuronium, fentanyl, and remifentanil and maintained with desflurane. The patient's vital signs remained stable while resection of the distal stomach, gallbladder, distal common bile duct, and pancreatic head was performed. Bleeding from the first jejunal vein (J1V) occurred during adhesion detachment around the superior mesenteric vein (SMV), and clamping of the J1V was required to control the bleeding. Immediately after J1V clamping, bowel congestion progressed because the patient's intestinal blood flow had been bypassed from the SMV to the inferior pancreaticoduodenal vein through J1V due to complete obstruction of the portal vein by the tumor. Therefore, a heparin-coated bypass tube (ANTHRON\u2122 bypass tube, TORAY MEDICAL Co., Tokyo, Japan) was inserted from the SMV to the right great saphenous vein to relieve the bowel congestion. Several minutes after insertion of the ANTHRON\u2122 bypass tube, blood potassium level rose from 4.7 mEq/L to 6.0 mEq/L, and pulseless ventricular tachycardia occurred. Chest compression was promptly performed by surgeons, and anesthesiologists attempted direct current defibrillation several times; epinephrine, magnesium sulphate, bicarbonate, lidocaine, and amiodarone were also administered. In addition to resuscitation, anesthesiologists inserted a blood-access catheter to the right internal jugular vein and started continuous renal replacement therapy to prevent elevation of blood potassium level. Spontaneous circulation was recovered after 30 min. The surgical team decided to discontinue the surgery, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) after packing gauze into the abdomen and with the ANTHRON\u2122 bypass tube left inserted. Total blood loss was 5620 mL, and total fluid balance was + 6115 mL. The operation time was 10 h 30 min. Two days after the first operation, the patient was scheduled to undergo tumor resection and portal vein reconstruction with REIV. The surgical team abandoned using the left internal jugular vein for portal vein reconstruction because of concerns that brain congestion after harvesting the jugular vein could affect brain function recovery. Anesthesia was maintained with dexmedetomidine, fentanyl, rocuronium, and remifentanil. Continuous hemodiafiltration had been performed in the ICU due to persistent anuria and continued during the operation to prevent hyperkalemia. Both legs were compressed with a pneumatic compression device throughout the operation to prevent deep venous thrombosis formation. A section of the REIV 5 cm in length was harvested intraperitoneally with a surgical stapler, and the REIV distal end was closed with a 4-0 polypropylene running suture. The inferior epigastric vein, pubic branch of the obturator vein, and the deep circumflex iliac vein were preserved. A surgical nurse noticed swelling of the patient's right leg 2 h after harvesting; the surgical team ensured careful observation throughout the surgery because a transient change by congestion of the right leg was suspected. Blood potassium level was slightly elevated after REIV resection, but ventricular arrhythmia was absent. Surgery was completed as scheduled (operation time, 7 h 3 min), and the patient was transferred to the ICU again. Total blood loss and total fluid balance were 2485 mL and + 2587 mL, respectively. On ICU admission, distention and fullness of the right leg worsened. An orthopedist diagnosed the patient with acute compartment syndrome, and right leg elevation to lower the intracompartmental pressure was initiated. Blood potassium level was rapidly elevated immediately after leg elevation (Fig. ), which caused sustained ventricular tachycardia despite efforts to lower blood potassium level such as the administration of bicarbonate, glucose-insulin, and continuous hemodialysis with potassium-free dialysate. Chest compressions were initiated immediately. Ventricular tachycardia was prolonged; therefore, veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-A ECMO) was induced, and spontaneous circulation was recovered after resolution of hyperkalemia (Fig. , Table ). Emergent fasciotomy was performed by orthopedists 1 h after induction of V-A ECMO because the intracompartmental tissue pressure of the anterior compartment was 70 mmHg. V-A ECMO was withdrawn 2 days later, and the patient was extubated 10 days after portal vein reconstruction. He had no apparent neural deficits; however, paralysis and paresthesia of the right leg persisted after discharge from the ICU 17 days post-operatively.",

        "Patient Note": "A 62-year-old man was admitted to the neurology department complaining of an inability to see in the right eye for 2 days along with acute headache. He had a history of atrial fibrillation in rheumatic heart disease and suffered an ischaemic stroke in the left frontotemporal parietal lobe 4 years ago. The right limb of the patient was left with sequelae of mild paralysis, and he gradually developed mild vascular dementia; however, he could communicate with family members normally in daily life. He suffered symptomatic epilepsy due to ischaemic stroke 2 years ago, and effective antiepileptic drugs (500 mg levetiracetam bid and 500 mg valproic acid bid) were prescribed. At the first medical evaluation, the arterial pressure was 170/100 mmHg, and arterial blood lactic acid was 3.3 mmol/L. Liver function, renal function, electrolytes, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, procalcitonin, cerebrospinal fluid examination, syphilis antibody and HIV testing were normal. Neurological examination revealed a cognitive decline wherein the patient could not accurately answer questions or simply reply with short sentences or words. Ophthalmological examination found that when the patient\u2019s eyes were unshielded, he needed to walk with help to distinguish orientations. Neither eye of the patient could read a visual chart clearly, but he could grasp a pen when shaken in front of both eyes, suggesting macular avoidance or partial visual field avoidance. The patient suffered sudden visual impairment, acute headache and progressive dementia, which suggested that the lesion may be located in the cerebral cortex. An MRI was then performed, which showed marked diffuse cortical hyperintensities in the left temporoparietal and occipital lobes on T2 and diffusion-weighted images. The apparent diffusion coefficient map demonstrated decreased signal intensity in the area of interest compared with the control region. Thus, the lesion was identified, while the differential diagnosis was relatively difficult. The patient had rheumatic heart disease and atrial fibrillation, which were risk factors for arterial cerebral infarction. However, CT angiography did not find corresponding vascular occlusion, and the lesion was not consistent with the vascular distribution. Thus, arterial cerebral infarction was excluded. The patient did not have drug or poison contact. Liver function, kidney function and plasma glucose were normal. Metabolism or toxic encephalopathy was less possible. Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) was another possible diagnosis, as it could present with similar symptoms and the elevated blood pressure obtained at admission. However, the lesion was located on one side of the cortex, and the focus was a cytotoxic brain oedema. RPLS was less likely because its focus is often vasogenic oedema and symmetric. The lesion was located in the cortex of the left temporoparietal occipital lobes, and the lactate level was increased at admission. MELAS could not be completely ruled out. However, the patient did not have exercise intolerance in the past and had a rather older age. We found that the lactic acid level was normal. These clinical data did not suggest a diagnosis of MELAS. One day after hospitalization, the patient suffered limb twitches of the right lower limb lasting for approximately 1 min., and his wife told us that the patient was more taciturn than he had been in the past week, which she ignored at the beginning. Consequently, continuous EEG monitoring was performed, which found continuous sharp wave discharges, especially in the regions of the left temporal, parietal and occipital lobes. The patient had a history of epilepsy, acute headache, and visual and cognitive impairment. MRI found cytotoxic brain oedema in the left temporoparietal and occipital lobes, and EEG found sharp waves discharges mainly in the regions of the left central, parietal and occipital lobes. Taken together, these findings were most consistent with NCSE. Continuous intravenous administration of diazepam and oral addition of the antiepileptic drug topiramate (50 mg bid) were prescribed. After that, the patient recovered quickly, and follow-up EEG monitoring was normal. A follow-up MRI was performed 11 days later, which showed that the abnormal signal of the left parietooccipital occipital lobes was markedly attenuated (Fig. ). We concluded that the abnormal and reversible imaging on the MRI was TPMA.",

        "Patient Note": "A 13-year-old boy without any known chronic illness was admitted to our outpatient policlinic with complaints of fatigue, fever, sputum expectoration, vomiting, loss of appetite, and acute attacks of choking cough especially at night. The complaints had not decreased over the last 20 days despite the patient using different types of antibiotics. His general physical appearance was pale and exhausted. He had subfebrile fever of 37.5\u2103 and blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg. Physical examination revealed bilaterally reduced pulmonary sounds at the mid and lower zones with bilateral crepitations which were heard more in the right lung. Abdominal examination was normal without hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory findings showed leukocyte of 38,470/mm3(consisted of 92% neutrophil, 4.2% lymphocyte, 2.1% monocyte, and 1.5% eosinophil), hemoglobin of 14.3 g/dL, platelet of 437,000/\u00b5L and C-reactive protein of 120 mg/dL. Posteroanterior chest x-ray showed extensive infiltration in the mid and lower zones of the right lung with a round-shaped air-filled lesion (). Thoracic ultrasonography confirmed the presence of bronchogram in the lower zone of the right lung as a pneumonic consolidation. The possibility of abscess was excluded. Ampicillin/sulbactam in combination with amikasin was started. On the third day of treatment, the patient developed a confused state of mind together with tachypnea (60 times per minute), dyspnea, tachycardia (130 beats per minute), hypoxemia (oxygen saturation <90% under nasal oxygen flow at the rate of 6 L/min), and hypotension (75/40 mmHg). The patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit. Considering possible shock status due to staphylococcal pneumonia, an aggressive intravenous fluid regimen and a change in antibiotic treatment to vancomycin and meropenem were started. Respiratory distress did not improve despite intensive application of inhaled \u03b22 mimetic, inhaled corticosteroid and intravenous corticosteroid. The patient's immunity showed resistance to medical therapy and was clinically unstable. Since our hospital was lacking high-resolution computed tomography facility, the high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) examination could not be performed emergently.\nIn this case, HRCT examination was performed after stabilization of the patient, it showed a lobulated, 9 cm \u00d7 7 cm \u00d7 7-cm lesion with cavitation in the superior segment of the lower lobe of the right lung indicating a ruptured hydatid cyst (). The diagnosis of anaphylaxis due to ruptured hydatid cyst was confirmed. Medical history also showed that the patient had experienced expectoration of cystic fluid together with an acute attack of severe cough just 30 minutes before the onset of shock status. A repeated hemogram test showed hemoglobin level of 12.4 g/dL, platelet of 276,000/\u00b5L, and leukocyte of 28,440/mm3. The peripheric blood film showed an eosinophilic ratio of 45%. The diagnosis of echinococcal infection was supported with positive indirect hemagglutination (IHA) and immunofluorescence antibody technique (IFAT) results of 1/640 and 1/1,000 respectively. The patient was given albendazole with an oral dose of 15 mg/kg/day twice a day. A cystectomy and capitonage operation was performed in the patient and a postoperative chest x-ray showed sufficient expansion of the lungs (). In the follow-up, abdominal ultrasonography and chest x-rays were normal without any other pathology. The patient was discharged with albendazole treatment and a further follow-up plan was made.",

The patient\u2019s hypertension and left flank pain had often occurred simultaneously throughout the last 2 years, with his blood pressure fluctuating within 130\u2013150/90\u2013100 mmHg without treatment. Seven months previously, he had developed severe headache and worsening left flank pain, and his blood pressure reached 200/105 mmHg. Amlodipine (5 mg twice daily) and spironolactone (40 mg twice daily) were administered to reduce his blood pressure, but treatment was ineffective. His blood pressure had recently fluctuated within 150\u2013180/95\u2013110 mmHg, and he was hospitalized for further investigation.\nOn admission, the patient was 182 cm tall and weighed 68 kg. Physical examination revealed slight throbbing pain over the left kidney area with a visual analog scale score of 4. No other obvious abnormalities were found.\nLaboratory data revealed a normal 24-hour urine protein level at 135 mg (reference range, 0\u2013150 mg/24 hours), microscopic hematuria (2+), and increased plasma renin activity (renin activity, aldosterone, angiotensin I, and angiotensin II) (). Color Doppler ultrasound examination (HD9 color Doppler ultrasound system; Philips, Amsterdam, Netherlands) revealed diffuse renal lesions, a broadened inner diameter of the LRV (approximately 12.7 mm), and an inner LRV diameter of 4.1 mm at the level of the SMA\u2013aorta angle. These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of NCS (). In addition, a computed tomography (CT) examination was performed using a GE Discovery CT750 (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) with the following scanning parameters: tube voltage, 120 kV; tube current, 160\u2013360 mA; scanning slice thickness, 5 mm; and reconstruction slice thickness, 1.25 mm. CT angiography (CTA) confirmed NCS (). The patient had no history of familial hypertension or special medications. His thyroid function, cortisol concentration, prolactin concentration, and adrenocorticotropic hormone concentration were normal. Thin-section enhanced CT of the adrenals showed no adrenal enlargement or occupying lesions. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging showed no abnormalities. Renal artery CTA showed no stenosis. None of the above secondary hypertension-related examinations showed significant abnormalities. These findings indicated the possibility that the hypertension might be associated with the observed abnormal LRV anatomy.\nSelective renal arteriography and venography (GE Innova 3100; GE Healthcare) were performed. The renal arteriography data were normal, but left renal venography indicated that the LRV was significantly narrowed before descending into the inferior vena cava, with clear regular compression; the anterior vein was significantly dilated (approximately 13 mm), and left-side varicoceles were seen (). The inferior vena cava pressure was 6 mmHg, and the LRV pressure was 15 mmHg. These findings confirmed a definitive diagnosis of NCS.\nConsidering that the patient had severe flank pain and that his hypertension might have been associated with this pain, an endovascular stent (14 \u00d7 60 mm; C. R. Bard, Murray Hill, NJ, USA) was placed into the stenosed part of the LRV. As a result, normal blood flow resumed and the collateral circulation was reduced (). Follow-up renal venography revealed a 2-mmHg pressure gradient between the LRV and inferior vena cava. Finally, the patient\u2019s blood pressure was reduced to 130\u2013140/80\u201395 mmHg 1 day later without drugs, and his 3-day postoperative visual analog scale score for the left flank pain was reduced to 1 to 2. Aspirin (0.1 once daily; Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany) and clopidogrel (75 mg once daily; Sanofi, Paris, France) were administered as a blood thinner and decongestant, respectively. The hypertension and flank pain did not recur during the following 11 months. Because the patient declined to undergo a biopsy, a pathological examination could not be performed.",

We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 33.0 g albmumin/10.0 dL = 3.3 g albmumin/dL. The concentration value of 33.0 g albmumin/L converts to 3.3 g albmumin/dL. \nThe concentration of calcium is 8.4 mg/dL. \nPlugging these values into the formula, we get (0.8 * (4.0 g/dL - 3.3 g/dL)) + 8.4 mg/dL = 8.96 mg/dL.\nThe patient's corrected calcium concentration 8.96 mg/dL.",

        "Patient Note": "A 55-year-old woman was hospitalized in the nephrology unit of Huriez Hospital, Lille, in January 2016. She had no previous history of any major disease. She had been diagnosed a superficial spreading type melanoma of the right thigh in March 2015, with BRAF V600E mutation. In September 2015, a CT-scan detected a pulmonary metastasis. She was then treated with encorafenib (450 mg once a day per os), a new BRAF inhibitor, and binimetinib (45 mg twice a day per os), a MEK inhibitor.\nThe treatment started in November 2015, when serum creatinine concentration was 0.77 mg/dL. In January, the laboratory testing measured a serum creatinine concentration of 2.8 mg/dL, prompting transfer to our nephrology department. On arrival the patient's BP was 130/70 mm Hg, and her heart rate and temperature were 88 bpm and 37.6 \u00b0C, respectively. She weighed 74 kg. She only complained of having experienced joint pain in the previous few weeks, but examination revealed no arthritis. Otherwise, examination results were completely normal. She did not present any rash or skin lesions on the previous days. Her recent medical history did not record new events. Three days before she arrived, she took ibuprofen 200 mg twice a day. She did not take any other medication.\nThe patient's serum creatinine concentration was 2.8 mg/dL, with blood urea 114 mg/dL, sodium level 133 mmol/L, and potassium level 5 mmol/L. Albumin level was 33 g/L and calcium level 8.4 mg/dL. C-reactive protein level was 1.23 mg/dL. She had a leucocyte count of 11,000/mm3 including 8700 polynuclear neutrophils and 1500 lymphocytes without polynuclear eosinophils.\nUrine analysis showed a 1 g/day proteinuria, without leucocyturia or hematuria.\nSerum protein electrophoresis was normal. Plasma tests for antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody and antiglomerular basement membrane antibody were negative. The test for antinuclear antibodies was negative.\nA kidney biopsy was performed. Light microscopy revealed 6 glomeruli, including one that was globally sclerotic, with endocapillary proliferation in half of them. Four showed extracapillary proliferation with a granulomatous reaction. Several arterioles exhibited acute necrotizing arteritis with fibrinoid necrosis and a perivascular infiltrate that had a granulomatous appearance with palisading epithelioid macrophages. Major tubular necrosis was also present. Immunofluorescence was weakly positive for C1q and C3 staining, with focal and segmental endomembranous deposits. It was strongly positive for fibrinogen in the crescents. Immunostaining for kappa, lambda, IgG, IgA, and IgM was negative.\nElectron microscopy, in one glomerulus without crescent, showed podocytes with cytoplasmic swelling and vacuolization. There was also focal interdigitating foot-process effacement. We did not find any debris or deposit in the subendothelial space.\nEncorafenib and binimetinib were then stopped the 5th of January. The patient's serum creatinine decreased subsequently to 1.5 mg/dL at the beginning of February with a proteinuria stable at 1.2 g/24 hour. The patient did not receive steroids.\nStarting March 2016, she was subsequently treated with pembrolizumab, an immunotherapy targeting program cell death 1. From March to July 2016, serum creatinine level was around 1.1 mg/dL, and there was a resolution of proteinuria. However, there was neither improvement nor worsening of the cancer lesions with pembrolizumab. Therefore, in July 2016 dabrafenib and trametinib, alternative BRAF and MEK inhibitors were introduced, and pembrolizumab was stopped. In October 2016, serum creatinine was 1.0 mg/dL and urine analysis showed no proteinuria.",

        "Patient Note": "A 29-year-old multiparous female at 35 weeks and 6 days of gestational age arrived at our obstetrical triage unit in extremis with the chief complaint of abdominal pain. She was transported to the hospital by her male partner who provided the history. The abdominal pain was of abrupt onset approximately 1.5 hours prior to arrival and was mainly epigastric in origin. The partner observed a single episode of emesis en route and the gradual onset of confusion. The patient's prenatal course had otherwise been unremarkable. A physical examination revealed a lethargic and confused gravid female in apparent distress. The fundal height was 35 cm and the abdomen was diffusely tender. There was evidence of involuntary guarding and an absence of rebound tenderness. The systolic blood pressure was 60 mmHg as determined by palpation, pulse was 150 beats per minute, and body temperature was 38.2\u00b0C. She was able to localize pain and respond to simple commands. The obstetric history was significant for two prior uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal deliveries, one at term and one late preterm. An ultrasound study of the abdomen was performed at the bedside and showed a singleton fetus with a fetal heart rate of 70 beats per minute and free peritoneal fluid. The cervix was 3 cm dilated by digital examination, the membranes were intact, and there was no evidence of significant vaginal bleeding.\nTwo large bore intravenous lines were placed and aggressive fluid replacement was undertaken with normal saline. The systolic blood pressure improved modestly to 70/30. The fetal bradycardia persisted despite aggressive volume replacement, oxygen supplementation via nasal cannula, and position changes. An emergent exploratory laparotomy with cesarean delivery under general anesthesia was performed for the indications of suspected intra-abdominal hemorrhage and nonreassuring fetal heart tones. At the time of initial evaluation, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms was assumed to be uterine rupture. A Pfannenstiel incision was used to access the abdomen. Upon entering the peritoneal cavity, 1500 mL of hemoperitoneum was encountered. A viable female infant was delivered through a low transverse hysterotomy and transferred to the neonatologist for resuscitation. The hysterotomy site was closed and the abdomen and pelvis were packed with laparotomy sponges to control the hemorrhage and identify the source of bleeding. The packs were removed from the pelvis in a stepwise fashion. The uterus and accompanying pelvic structures were intact and were not the source of hemorrhage. Upon removing the packs from the upper abdomen, brisk bleeding was encountered following removal of the packs in the left upper quadrant. An intraoperative consultation was obtained from a general surgeon who created a midline vertical incision extending to the xiphoid. The lesser sac was opened revealing copious blood clot and a peripancreatic hematoma. Heavy bleeding from this area was encountered stemming from the spleen. A splenectomy and distal pancreatectomy were performed with cessation of bleeding. Intraoperatively, she received six units of packed red blood cells, four liters of crystallized fluids, four units of fresh frozen plasma, and one pack of pooled platelets after an estimated three-liter blood loss. She received two prophylactic doses of Cefazolin. Her abdomen was closed after a Jackson Pratt drain was placed, and she was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.\nPostoperatively, broad spectrum antibiotics were administered empirically for 6 days for leukocytosis and persistent fever to 38.2\u00b0C. A discrete source of infection was not identified. Appropriate vaccinations were administered to Haemophilus influenza, seasonal influenza, pneumococcus, and meningococcus. She was discharged home in stable condition on hospital day 8 with one week of oral antibiotics. The patient's long-term course was complicated by a pancreatic fistula that resolved with conservative management. Final pathology revealed a 165-gram spleen measuring 10.8 \u00d7 6.8 \u00d7 4.5 cm with a large aneurysm of the main splenic arterial branch.\nThe neonate was born with APGARS 0 and 2, an arterial blood gas pH of 6.507, pCO2 of 176, and a base excess of \u221229.4. The neonate was resuscitated, intubated, and given head cooling measures for suspected hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. An MRI of the head showed multiple brainstem infarcts. The neonate had multiple procedures performed to include tracheostomy and percutaneous gastrostomy. The infant was with severe neurologic impairment at one year of age.",

        "Patient Note": "An 85-year-old menopausal woman was referred to our hospital for diagnostic evaluation of worsening dyspnea over 6 weeks. The patient had a history of chronic atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) of uncertain etiology. She had a uterine fibroid diagnosed at 64 years of age. Pre-admission medication included amlodipine (10 mg/day), valsartan (40 mg/day), verapamil (120 mg/day), digoxin (0.125 mg/day), and rivaroxaban (10 mg/day).\nHer vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 146/97 mmHg, heart rate 90 beats/min and irregular, and respiratory rate 21 breaths/min. Physical examination revealed a third heart sound, diminished breath sounds from the right lower lungs, and notable bilateral leg edema, but no remarkable jugular vein distention (JVD) was observed. A hard mass was palpable in the lower abdomen. The electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation. Chest radiography revealed cardiomegaly and right-sided PE (Fig. a). Laboratory testing revealed elevated levels of serum creatinine (1.36 mg/dL, reference, 0.65\u20131.07 mg/dL) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) (183 pg/mL, reference: < 18.4 pg/mL). Hepatic and thyroid function, C-reactive protein levels, and urinalysis were within normal ranges.\nEchocardiography demonstrated normal left ventricular (LV) cavity size and systolic function, with an ejection fraction of 54% and left atrial dilation (35 mL/m2) (Additional files and ). Doppler and tissue Doppler profiles for the assessment of LV diastolic function revealed a decreased septal e\u2032 of 5.8 cm/sec and an elevated E/e\u2032 of 17, indicating elevated LV filling pressure. In addition, continuous wave Doppler revealed a peak tricuspid regurgitation velocity of 2.6 m/s, consistent with a pressure gradient of 27 mmHg and an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of approximately 35 mmHg. Echocardiographic evaluation of the right heart revealed almost normal systolic function; tissue Doppler of the free lateral wall (S\u2032) = 9 cm/s (reference: \u2265 10 cm/s), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion = 18 mm (reference: 16 \u2265 mm), and fractional area change = 53% (reference: \u2265 35%), respectively.\nThus, a tentative diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) was made. The patient was administered oxygen at 3 L/min and treated with intravenous loop diuretics (furosemide 40 mg daily). On day 6, although diuretic treatment improved leg edema, PE remained unchanged (Fig. b).\nA subsequent diagnostic workup of unexplained PE was performed. The patient underwent thoracentesis with drainage of 1240 mL of serosanguineous PE. PE analysis revealed lymphocyte-predominant exudates fulfilling Light\u2019s criteria (Table ). Additionally, the serum-to-effusion albumin gradient was 0.3 g/dL (reference: \u2264 1.2 g/dL), further confirming the true exudative effusion. The adenosine deaminase activity in PE was 9.3 U/L. PE cytology, as well as the bacterial and mycobacterial cultures, were unremarkable.\nChest computed tomography revealed an absence of lung tumors or inflammatory infiltration after the removal of PE. Abdominal/pelvic computed tomography scan revealed bilateral inhomogeneous ovarian masses (Fig. ). Magnetic resonance imaging further characterized the right substantial mass and detected a trivial ascites (Fig. ). Axial and sagittal T2-weighted images demonstrated the peripheral hypointense mass, which contained hyperintense and multilocular areas in the central portion, mimicking a malignant ovarian tumor with a central necrosis or a degenerated subserosal fibroid. Gadolinium-enhanced axial imaging showed inhomogeneous enhancement correspondently on the peripheral solid portion, suggesting malignancy. In addition, screening tests for tumor markers revealed elevated CA-125 levels (382 U/mL, reference: < 35 U/mL). Repeated serial thoracentesis was ineffective, and PE reaccumulated within a week (Fig. c-f). Thus, we highly suspected of ovarian cancer with pleural dissemination. Nevertheless, a repeated cytological examination of PE revealed no evidence of malignancy, which led us to consider the possibility of MS.\nOn day 26, the patient underwent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (Fig. ). The resected masses exhibited yellow-to-tan fleshy cut surfaces, with hemorrhage and extensive hyaline degeneration. Histopathological examination revealed a mitotically active cellular fibroma (MACF) of the ovary. Spontaneous resolution of the right-sided PE was noted post-operatively after 7 days of follow-up, confirming a definitive diagnosis of MS. A follow-up echocardiography revealed no significant changes. The post-operative course was uneventful, and the patient made a full recovery and was discharged with no changes to her pre-admission medication regimen on day 33. She remained clinically stable upon subsequent follow-up.",

Because the INR is between 1.7 and 2.3, we add two to the score, making the current total 0 + 2 = 2.\nThe concentration of bilirubin is 2.6 \u00b5mol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of bilirubin from \u00b5mol to mg. The mass of bilirubin is 2.6 \u00b5mol. To convert 2.6 \u00b5mol of bilirubin to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 2.6 \u00b5mol bilirubin * 1e-06 mol/\u00b5mol = 2.6e-06 mol bilirubin. To convert from mol bilirubin to grams, multiply by the molar mass 548.66 g/mol, which will give 2.6e-06 mol bilirubin * 548.66 g/mol = 0.00143 g bilirubin. To convert 0.00143 g of bilirubin to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.00143 g bilirubin * 1000.0 mg/g = 1.43 mg bilirubin. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 1.43 mg bilirubin/10.0 dL = 0.143 mg bilirubin/dL. The concentration value of 2.6 \u00b5mol bilirubin/L converts to 0.143 mg bilirubin/dL. Because the bilirubin concentration is less than 2 mg/dL, we add 1 to the score, making the current total 2 + 1 = 3.\nThe concentration of albumin is 3.7 g/dL.

        "Patient Note": "A 56-year-old woman with a history notable for stage III sigmoid colon adenocarcinoma presents to the clinic with two days of progressive discomfort in the left calf, described as a deep, dull ache that is worse with standing and prolonged walking and improved slightly with rest and leg elevation. She underwent a laparoscopic left hemicolectomy five weeks ago without intraoperative complications and was discharged home on postoperative day 2. She has remained ambulatory since discharge and continues to perform activities of daily living independently, including short neighborhood walks, without any period of enforced bed rest. She started adjuvant chemotherapy with a fluoropyrimidine-based regimen three weeks ago and is currently between treatment cycles. She denies recent long-distance travel, trauma to the limb, or new vigorous exercise. There is no history of casts, splints, or braces applied to the lower limbs. She denies focal weakness, numbness, or any change in her ability to move the leg. She reports no fever or chills, no systemic malaise beyond her usual chemotherapy-related fatigue, and no skin breaks or insect bites on the affected limb. She denies chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath. On examination, she appears well and in no acute distress. Vital signs: temperature 36.9\u00b0C, blood pressure 128/76 mm Hg, pulse 88 bpm regular, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 98% on room air. Inspecting the left lower extremity reveals a network of newly prominent superficial veins coursing over the medial calf and along the posterior-lateral aspect of the lower thigh that appear straight and thin-walled rather than tortuous, more conspicuous than on prior visits according to the patient, and without overlying inflammation. There is no erythema or warmth of the entire limb; the skin is intact with normal turgor and no lesions. Palpation elicits focal tenderness along the posterior calf tracking proximally into the popliteal fossa, with discomfort most pronounced along the expected course of the deep venous system; there is no discrete palpable superficial cord. Gentle firm pressure over the pretibial area and medial malleolus does not leave an indentation, and there is no impression that edema is accentuated on only one side. The Achilles tendon is nontender, and there is no joint line tenderness of the knee or ankle. Passive and active range of motion at the knee and ankle are full and do not reproduce the pain. Distal pulses (dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial) are palpable and symmetric. Strength testing is 5/5 throughout the lower extremities with intact sensation to light touch and pinprick, and reflexes are physiologic. Gait is normal. There is no inguinal lymphadenopathy. Abdominal exam shows well-healed laparoscopic port sites without tenderness or hernia. Given the clinical picture, considerations such as muscle strain are less compelling in the absence of an inciting activity and with pain localized along the deep venous tract rather than the musculotendinous junctions, and cellulitis is not supported by the lack of warmth, erythema, fever, or skin disruption. Findings do not suggest a ruptured Baker cyst, as there is no fullness in the popliteal fossa, no ecchymosis tracking down the calf, and the knee exam is benign. The patient\u2019s ongoing malignancy and recent abdominal surgery within the past several weeks place her at increased thrombotic risk. She has not experienced any period of prolonged immobilization and remains active at home. At the time of presentation, no anticoagulants have been administered and no diagnostic imaging has been performed. The overall presentation raises concern for a thrombotic process in the left lower extremity in the context of active cancer therapy and recent major surgery, with focal tenderness along the venous pathway and newly visible superficial venous channels that are not consistent with longstanding varicosities.",

The patient was suspected to be in the window period of hepatitis B based on the detection of IgM anti-HBc antibody (+) with increased aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels in his blood about a month ago. He had been drinking approximately a bottle of beer once a month but does not smoke. His family history was not significant. At the time of his visit to this hospital, his blood pressure was 120/80 mm Hg; pulse rate, 76/min; respiration rate, 20/min; and temperature, 36.5\u2103. Moreover, the patient was conscious and had no specific symptom but fatigue. His breath sound was normal during chest auscultation; neither whole body jaundice nor icteric sclera was observed. No tactile mass was noted in the abdominal region; neither abdominal pain nor abdominal fluid was found. The peripheral blood test showed that his hemoglobin was 14.6 g/dL (reference range, 11\u201316 g/dL); white blood cell count, 4,880 cells/mcL (reference range, 3,600\u20139,500 cells/mcL); and platelet, 181,000 cells/mcL (reference range, 150,000\u2013450,000 cells/mcL).

The immunoserological test found hepatitis B surface (HBs) antigen/antibody (\u2212/\u2212), hepatitis B e (HBe) antigen/antibody (\u2212/\u2212), hepatitis C virus antibody (\u2212), anti-hepatitis A virus (HAV) IgM (\u2212), anti-HAV IgG (\u2212), IgM anti-HBc antibody (+), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA quantification (\u2212) (). He was diagnosed with PBC because of his increased ALP and GGT levels in the blood test and increased IgM/IgG (518/1,740 mg/dL) in the additional blood test; he was also both AMA and antinuclear antibody (ANA) positive. Nothing significant was noted on his chest and simple abdominal X-ray. Moreover, no abnormal findings were observed; however, an approximately 2 cm hepatic cyst was found through abdominal computed tomography (). The development of the disease and screen associated autoimmune hepatitis was assessed. Liver biopsy found intrahepatic bile duct injury and epithelial cell infiltration in the lymphocytes, both of which characterize PBC, but did not indicate severe fibrosis or any condition that suggested autoimmune hepatitis (). Based on AMA and ANA (+) and the blood test results, which suggested a cholestatic disease, he was diagnosed with PBC. The patient was administered with a high dose of ursodesoxycholic acid (UDCA, 900 mg/d) for three months. After the treatment, both fatigue and pruritus decreased, and the AST, ALT, ALP, and GGT were 34, 18, 350, and 107 IU/L, respectively.

He was tachypneic (respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute) and the peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) in room air was 92%. The abdominal palpation revealed hepatosplenomegaly. The laboratory tests showed a white blood count (WBC) of 8000 cells/mcL with 74% neutrophils, thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 31,000/mcL), total bilirubin 5.8 mg/dL, C-Reactive Protein (CRP) 43 mg/L, creatinine 0.9 mg/dL, AST 150 UI/L, ALT 79 UI/L. The nasopharyngeal swab testing for SARS-CoV-2 was negative (RT-PCR). Blood cultures were carried out upon admission and a full-body computer tomography (CT) was performed on the second day of hospitalization. The CT showed ground glass bilateral pulmonary alterations, pericardial effusion, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly (). The neck CT scan with intravenous contrast evidenced a 5.4 cm retropharyngeal abscess with associated thrombosis of the left anterior jugular vein (). On the second day of hospitalization, the microbiology laboratory communicated the early identification of Fusobacterium necrophorum grown in blood cultures by MALDI-TOF (Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight) spectrometry -Vitek \u00aeMS Blood cultures performed at admission and on the second day and collected in standard anaerobic blood culture bottles were positive (). The association of retropharyngeal abscess with thrombosis of the anterior jugular and involvement of other organs systemically and the microbiology led to the diagnosis of Lemierre's syndrome. Despite empirical antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam (18 g/day, continuous infusion), there was a rapid worsening of the clinical conditions with further impairment of the respiratory failure and severe hemodynamic alterations (mean arterial pressure (MAP) constantly <65 mmHg). This picture suggested a progression towards a septic shock status. Consequently, the patient was referred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). A multimodal approach was the core of the ICU management of Lemierre's septic syndrome. It included source control, antibiotic therapy, anticoagulant therapy, hemodynamic support, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) (). The source control was planned in a sterile environment. Under general anesthesia, the patient underwent an explorative puncture of the retropharyngeal abscess and surgical tracheostomy for airway protection. Unfortunately, although the procedure revealed purulent material, surgeons were unable to collect suitable samples for microbiological testing. At ICU admission, the patient showed a clinical and radiological picture of acute lung injury and the need for deep sedation (propofol, remifentanil, and clonidine), and mechanical ventilation through protective ventilation (tidal volume 6 mL/kg and driving pressure < 15 cmH2O) and high FiO2 (80%). The sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score was 12, predicting a high mortality rate (50%) []. About antibiotic therapy, metronidazole (500 mg q8hr, intravenously) was added to piperacillin/tazobactam (started empirically at hospital admission). This antibiotic therapy was based on anecdotal clinical evidence because, due to the lack of cards for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of anaerobes in the laboratory, the antibiogram was not performed. Hemodynamic support was based on the synergic association of norepinephrine and the non-adrenergic vasopressor argipressin (also known as arginine-vasopressin or anti-diuretic hormone) (EMPRESSIN\u00ae AOP Orphan Pharmaceutical Group) starting with norepinephrine at 0.3 mcg/kg/min and argipressin at 0.03 IU/min to maintain a MAP > 65 mmHg and lactic acid < 2 mmol/L. On day 2, the drug synergism allowed the rapid reduction of the norepinephrine and argipressin dosages (0.1 mcg/kg/min and 0.025 IU/min, respectively) (). On the same day (day 2), there was an enhancement in the clinical conditions, and the biomarkers of inflammation and organ failure improved (). Despite the adequate MAP (>65 mmHg), from the 3rd to the 6th day of ICU admission, there was a new worsening of the clinical status. It featured anemia (worse value 6.8 g/dL) without evidence of a hemorrhagic source. The hemodynamic monitoring (Edwards EV1000\u2122 device) showed a hyperdynamic septic state (Cardiac Output 15 L/min, Systemic Vascular Resistance 300 dynes/seconds/cm). Due to the worsening of the sepsis-related organ damage, on the 8th day, hydrocortisone (200 mg/day) was added to argipressin and norepinephrine. This approach led to a paramount hemodynamic improvement. From the 8th day of hospitalization, there was a progressive reduction of the dose of both vasoconstrictors until the suspension of norepinephrine, on day 9, and argipressin, on day 12 of ICU stay. Moreover, there was an important decrease in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (from 12 on ICU admission to 7 on day 9). The worsening of the clinical status and the anemia were associated with bilirubin and cytokines rise. The inflammatory response was treated by 4 cycles of continuous hemofiltration (from 4th to 7th day). At the end of the procedure, there was an unexpected rise in D-dimers and in bilirubin values, up to 15.3 mg/dL (10th day), as well as hyperpyrexia. Nevertheless, these findings improved within 24 h. Heparin therapy was administered throughout the entire stay according to thrombocytopenia (enoxaparin 6000 U/day at the beginning and 4000 U twice a day after normalization of the platelet count) monitoring D-dimer values and avoiding intravascular coagulopathy. On the 9th day, a chest tube was placed for the drainage of lung pleural effusion and a new CT was carried out. It showed a persistence of the known injuries of the lungs, liver, and spleen despite the paramount improvements of laboratory and clinical values, as well as the normalization of hemodynamic parameters at monitoring. The patient was discharged to the ward on the 17th day to continue the antibiotic therapy and the rehabilitation program. After the discharge to the rehabilitation care unit, the young man was in good health condition. At the first follow up, performed 15 days after ICU admission, the CT scan showed better lungs ventilation, absence of retropharyngeal abscess, laterocervical lymphadenopathy, and internal jugular thrombosis. Hepatosplenomegaly and some cavitary lungs lesions were found. Another thoracic CT scan was performed after 3 months. It demonstrated an improvement of both the lung lesions and hepatosplenomegaly.",

He reported no fever, abdominal pain, or vomiting. For the 4 weeks prior to his admission, he also suffered from progressive fatigue, poor oral intake, pale stools, and decreased urine output. His past medical history was significant for well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and stage 3A chronic kidney disease (baseline serum creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL, estimated glomerular filtration rate of 48.8 mL/min/1.73 m2). His family history was negative for any kidney disease or malignancy. He had no history of herbal medicine use, intravenous drug abuse, tattoos, or blood transfusions. On physical examination, he was alert and oriented with severe jaundice, a distended abdomen with an enlarged liver, and a 1+ bilateral pitting edema of his lower extremities. He had no stigmata of chronic liver disease. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nLaboratory data were as follows: hemoglobin = 9.6 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) = 85 fL, white blood cells = 11,880/mm3 (neutrophil 81%, lymphocyte 4.9%, monocyte 12%), platelets = 384,000/mm3, international normalized ratio (INR) = 2.2, blood urea nitrogen = 73.8 mg/dL, serum creatinine = 7.78 mg/dL, sodium = 133 mEq/L, potassium = 3.8 mEq/L, bicarbonate = 16.8 mEq/L, chloride = 92 mEq/L, calcium = 8.7 mg/dL, phosphorus = 4.8 mg/dL, magnesium = 2.8 mg/dL, and glycated hemoglobin = 7.1%. Liver function tests revealed the following: total cholesterol = 177 mg/dL, total protein = 5.4 g/dL, albumin = 2.8 g/dL, globulin = 2.6 g/dL, total bilirubin = 36.1 mg/dL, direct bilirubin = 35 mg/dL, alanine transaminase (ALT) = 53 U/L, aspartate transaminase (AST) = 109 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) = 408 U/L. Serum tests for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C were negative. Serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) levels were 850 U/mL (0\u201337). Urine appeared greenish with a specific gravity of 1.010, trace proteinuria, 5\u201310 red blood cells (RBCs)/high-power field, 1\u20132 white blood cells/high-power field along with numerous muddy brown granular casts (Fig. ), and bile casts (Fig. ). No RBC casts were found. The fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) was 2.7%, and FEurea was 44.8%. Abdominal computed tomography showed 4.3 \u00d7 4.2 cm and 3.1 \u00d7 3.5 cm inhomogeneous enhancing masses at liver segment 4A with moderately dilated intrahepatic ducts (Fig. ). Based on the symptoms of biliary obstruction, typical imaging findings, and elevated serum CA 19-9, the most likely diagnosis was cholangiocarcinoma (Bismuth\u2013Corlette type IIIb). He was initially given intravenous fluids to combat his oliguric renal failure, but there was no improvement in serum creatinine and urine output. Over the next 5 days, hemodialysis was initiated due to diuretic-resistant oliguric acute renal failure. Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) was also performed to relieve his obstructive jaundice. However, he still experienced clinical deterioration. After approximately 2 weeks of hemodialysis, his total serum bilirubin continued to be in the 30 mg/dL range and he remained oliguric. On the 27th day of admission, the patient suffered from massive biliary hemorrhage requiring a blood transfusion. An emergency esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed and revealed active hemorrhage from the ampulla of Vater, a finding suggestive of tumor bleeding. After thorough discussion and consultation between the patient's family and the palliative care team, the healthcare providers proceed to initiate palliative treatment.",

At the time of admission, his guardians brought the container of the antifreeze that he had ingested, which was then checked accordingly. The patient had an elevated blood pressure of 130/79 mmHg, pulse rate of 98 beats/min, and respiration rate of 30 breaths/min at the time of admission; his body temperature was 35.4\u2103. He showed signs of acute illness and presented with lethargic consciousness and restlessness. No other specific findings were found. The venous blood gas analysis results showed pH 6.90, PaCO2 34 mmHg, PaO2 25 mmHg, bicarbonate 6.7 mmol/L, base excess \u221226.1 mmol/L, and oxygen saturation 15%. Serum biochemical analysis showed sodium 136.4 mEq/L, potassium 7.80 mEq/L, chloride 110 mEq/L, calcium 9.9 mg/dL, phosphorus 3.2 mg/dL, glucose 125 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 11 mg/dL, and creatinine 1.67 mg/dL. The patient also showed signs of high anion gap metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 19.7 mmol/L. Urinalysis showed proteinuria and microscopic hematuria. Electrocardiogram findings showed sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 134 beats/min, whereas chest radiography showed mild pulmonary edema. Fluid replacement, sodium bicarbonate, and thiamine were administered as the initial treatment, and fomepizole was loaded at 15 mg/kg intravenously and administered four times, each at 10 mg/kg in 12-h intervals. One hour after admission, the patient's consciousness deteriorated from lethargy to stupor, necessitating tracheal intubation. Two hours after admission, overall condition deteriorated and acidosis was not corrected. Consequently, he was transferred to the intensive care unit, where continuous renal replacement therapy was initiated. Thirty hours after dialysis, metabolic acidosis was controlled, as indicated by pH 7.46, PaCO2 36 mmHg, PaO2 106 mmHg, HCO3 25.6 mEq/L, and anion gap 5.9 mmol/L (). His vital signs stabilized on the 6th day of admission, and consequently, he was extubated. However, the patient's levels of BUN and creatinine remained elevated at 39 and 4.28 mg/dL, respectively, and his hourly urine output was only 10\u201330 mL, and calcium oxalate crystals were detected on urine microscopy (). The patient's acute renal failure persisted, and therefore the treatment was switched to routine hemodialysis, maintained at three rounds every other day. Starting from the 12th day of admission and the start of dialysis, daily urine output increased to >1,000 mL; thus, dialysis was discontinued. On the 23rd day of admission, the serum BUN/creatinine level decreased to 18.4/1.73 mg/dL, and the daily urine output was being maintained at 3000\u20134000 mL. The patient was discharged and monitored through Follow-ups. During the outpatient follow-up visit at 3 months after discharge, the levels of BUN and creatinine were 17 and 0.95 mg/dL, respectively, with no proteinuria or hematuria ().",

        "Patient Note": "A 44-year-old male was emergently admitted to our hospital because of hematemesis due to the rupture of gastroesophageal varices. Prior to admission, he had no remarkable medical history. There was no family history of liver diseases. He was not a habitual drinker and did not take other drugs. Two years before admission, his height was 172.2 cm, his body weight was 120.1 kg, and his BMI was 40.5. On admission, his body weight was 116.7 kg and his BMI was 39.4. Physical examination demonstrated mild anemia in the palpebral conjunctiva and hepatosplenomegaly in the abdomen. Neurological findings were not remarkable. Laboratory data are shown in Table . White blood cell count was increased (15,100/\u00b5L), and platelet count was within normal limits (18.3 \u00d7 104/\u00b5L), while hemoglobin was 7.0 g/dL due to bleeding. Biochemical examination showed serum total bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL, albumin 2.9 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 19 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 18 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 135 U/L, and gamma-glutamic transpeptidase 65 U/L, respectively. C-reactive protein was slightly elevated (1.33 mg/dL). Hyaluronic acid (187 ng/mL), type 4 collagen (248 ng/mL), and Mac2-binding protein (2.71 COI) were increased. Aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) [] and fibrosis-4 (FIB4) index [] were not elevated (APRI = 0.346 and FIB4 index = 1.08, respectively). APRI and FIB4 were calculated according to the following formula; APRI = AST level (IU/L) / upper limit of normal AST \u00d7 100 / platelet count (109/L), and FIB4 = age (year) \u00d7 AST (IU/L) / {platelet count (109/L) \u00d7 [ALT (U/L)]1/2}. Serum ferritin and ceruloplasmin were within normal limits. Hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B virus core antibody, and hepatitis C virus antibody were all negative. Antinuclear antibody was elevated (\u00d7160), whereas antimitochondrial antibody and antiglutamic acid decarboxylase antibody were negative. Immunoglobulins, including IgG, IgM, and IgA, were within normal limits. Coagulation tests revealed a decrease in the percentage of prothrombin time (53.6%). Hemoglobin A1c was 8.1%, glycoalbumin was 16.7%, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was 298 mg/dL, immunoreactive insulin (IRI) was 14.5 \u03bcIU/mL. Quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) was 0.28. The QUICKI was a novel and accurate method for determining insulin resistance; QUICKI = 1 / (log fasting IRI [\u03bcU/mL] + log FPG [mg/dL]) []. Abdominal ultrasonography examination showed brightness, mild hepatorenal echo contrast, surface irregularity, dullness of the edge of the liver, and splenomegaly (Fig. \u2013c). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) demonstrated enlargement of the left hepatic lobe and splenomegaly, which corresponded to liver cirrhosis (Fig. ). Active contrast material extravasation was also seen, which represented active bleeding from gastroesophageal varices (Fig. , f). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed gastroesophageal varices (Fig. , h). White plug, which seemed to be the bleeding lesion, was also seen in gastric varices (Fig. ). The varices were treated by endoscopic injection sclerotherapy and endoscopic variceal ligation. The histological findings of liver biopsy were mild steatosis, mild chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate, and severe fibrosis in the expanded portal areas with bridging fibrosis and spotty or focal necrosis (Fig. \u2013d). Vacuolation of the nucleus (Fig. ) and MDBs (Fig. ) were also seen. Immunostaining using anti-p62/SQSTM1 antibody (Medical and Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan) demonstrated MDBs, which were irregularly shaped cytoplasmic inclusions (Fig. , d) typically located in proximity to the nucleus (Fig. arrows). Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with portal hypertension and liver cirrhosis due to NASH. He was also diagnosed, for the first time, with T2DM based on the following findings: FPG exceeding 126 mg/dL, random glucose level over 200 mg/dL, and hemoglobin A1c over 6.5%. Because hyperglycemia persisted after admission, we started insulin therapy. After starting insulin treatment, hyperglycemia immediately improved. Subsequently, we started the administration of tofogliflozin, a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor.",

        "Patient Note": "A 44-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with a drowsy mental status since a few days ago. She had a history of ulcerative colitis that was treated with medication (oral prednisolone 35mg/day, mesalazine 3,000 mg/day). Two weeks prior to admission, she had discontinued the steroid treatment and wanted to be treated with alternative medicine that included sodium chloride, multivitamin, and selenium with discontinuation of her regular diet.\nClinically, she was severely dehydrated due to frequent watery diarrhea. She was hypotensive and her blood pressure was 80/50mmHg. On initial examination, she was stuporous and slightly confused, and she responded only to painful stimuli and had weakness in both arms and legs. A hypoactive deep tendon reflex was present, but there were no other focal neurological deficits or neck stiffness.\nInitial blood laboratory test results showed a sodium level of 197mEq/L (range, 135-146mEq/L), potassium level of 2.9mEq/L (range, 3.5-5.3mEq/L), chloride level of 159mEq/L (range, 99-108mEq/L), blood urea nitrogen level of 96mg/dL (range, 8-19mg/dL), creatinine level of 1.56mg/dL (range, 0.67-1.17mg/dL), serum osmolality of 415mOsm/kgH2O(range, 280-300mOsm/kgH2O), ACTH level of 3.99 pg/mL (range, 7.2-63.3 pg/mL), and serum cortisol level of 30.84 ug/dL (range, 4.3-22.4 ug/dL). Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.030, osmolality of 885mOsm/kgH2O, urine sodium level of 12.0mEq/L, and urine creatinine level of 128.1mg/dL.\nThe patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit where intravenous fluids were rapidly administered and serial monitoring of electrolytes and osmolality was started. There was no evidence of adrenal insufficiency, but we intravenously administered dexamethasone 5mg and hydrocortisone 100mg/day considering her history of steroid use for protection from adrenal insufficiency. Immediate treatment with 0.45% saline and 5% dextrose water was started along with modification of the rate and concentration so that the fall in serum sodium level did not exceed 0.5mEq/L/hour. Despite our effort to avoid very rapid correction of hypernatremia, the correction rate exceeded 1mEq/L/hour (, ).\nSix days after admission, the serum sodium level was 149mEq/L and she had partially recovered her mental status, especially her early depression of consciousness level; however, weakness in all extremities persisted. Diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed on hospital day 6 revealed multifocal, symmetric, diffusion restriction within the lateral pons, thalami, and splenium of the corpus callosum(). However, there were no abnormal signal intensity changes on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. Considering the clinical and radiologic findings, despite the unusual pattern in the pons, our diagnosis was osmotic demyelination syndrome involving both the lateral pontine and extrapontine sites associated with rapid correction of hypernatremia. The patient was closely observed and was treated with corticosteroid therapy and conservative management including nutritional support.\nFollow-up MRI performed on hospital day 30 revealed high signal intensity changes in the lateral pons and bilateral thalami on FLAIR images, which were pseudonormalized on DW images (). The previously noted corpus callosum lesion had resolved on FLAIR and DW images. The patient's mental status and motor weakness were improved, and she was discharged to a rehabilitation hospital at hospital day 49. She remained free of neurologic symptoms during the 6-month follow-up period, and the serum sodium concentration had stabilized.",

The frequency and severity of his angina increased over time and the patient described a squeezing chest pain with an onset three days prior to presentation. The past medical history included hypertension, diagnosed three years ago, and smoking history of ten pack-years. There was no family history of coronary artery or hematologic disease. At the time of admission he was on aspirin and anti-hypertensive medications. On physical examination, the blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg and the heart rate was 70 beats per minute. The heart sounds were unremarkable with normal S1 and S2 sounds. The lungs were clear on auscultation. The electrocardiogram showed no ST-segment change, T wave inversion or pathologic Q waves suggestive of myocardial ischemia. No abnormality was found on chest roentgenogram. On complete blood count, the hemoglobin was 13.9 g/dL, white blood cell count was 9,400/L, and the platelet count was 106\u00d7104/\u00b5L. Electrolytes, renal and liver function tests were not remarkable. Levels of CK-MB and Troponin-T were within normal range. Total serum cholesterol was 161 mg/dL, triglyceride was 95 mg/dL and high-density lipoprotein was 39 mg/dL. Serum homocystein level was 12.7 nmol/mL (reference range 5-15 nmol/mL), and hsCRP was 1.91 mg/L (reference range <3 mg/L). Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time and fibrinogen level were within normal range. The iron profile was not remarkable. Bone marrow study showed a hypercellular marrow with markedly increased megakaryocytes, and a normal myeloid/erythroid ratio (). Chromosomal analysis of bone marrow cells revealed a normal 46, XY karyotype with no evidence of bcr/abl rearrangement. Liver and spleen were not enlarged on sonogram images. An elective coronary angiography, two days after admission, showed total occlusion at the mid right coronary artery (RCA) with well-developed collaterals from proximal RCA to PD and PL branches. In addition, there was diffuse irregular, up to 70%, luminal narrowing with haziness noted at the proximal RCA. The left coronary angiography showed a 40% luminal narrowing at the mid left anterior descending artery (LAD). The echocardiography, performed three days after admission, showed no regional wall motion abnormality with about 60% of left ventricular ejection fraction. On color Doppler imaging, there was no significant valvular stenosis or regurgitation noted. There was a relaxational abnormality observed in the diastolic filling pattern. The patient was taking aspirin 100 mg/day, clopidogrel 75 mg/day, atenolol 25 mg/day, diltiazem 90 mg/day and nicorandil 15 mg/day from the day of admission. The chest pain was controlled by medical treatment; therefore, we decided to postpone coronary artery intervention until the platelet count reached a normal level. Treatment with hyroxyurea 500 mg/day and anagrelide HCl 1 mg/day was started as cytostatic therapy. The platelet count was normalized (23\u00d7104/\u00b5L) five weeks after initiation of cytostatic therapy, and coronary artery intervention was then performed. The totally occluded mid RCA lesion was thought to be a chronic total occlusion because of the presence of good collateral flow from the proximal RCA. We thought that the proximal RCA, stenotic lesion with haziness, resulted from a plaque rupture resulting in an occlusive thrombus, and caused the ischemic symptoms that the patient presented with. Two coronary stents were placed at the proximal and mid RCA. No residual stenosis was observed after the procedure (). The LAD lesion was not treated. The patient was discharged two days after the procedure without any hemorrhagic or thrombotic complication; he remained on aspirin, clopidogrel, hydroxyurea, and anagrelide. The patient was free of symptoms for six months during the follow-up period, and his platelet count remained within normal range.",

During the examination he asks the physician if he should be taking a statin. He is 6'0'' tall, weighs 172 lbs, and has a BMI of 23.3. He is a nonsmoker with no history of diabetes, and his only medication is aspirin 81 mg/d. However, his father died of a myocardial infarction at age 54, which has led him to maintain a healthy lifestyle. He has a BP of 120/75 mmHg, TC = 190 mg/dL, LDL-C = 140 mg/dL, HDL-C = 49 mg/dL, and TGs = 120 mg/dL. Although this patient seems healthy and is very active, he is moderately high risk of CV disease due to his age. Thus, even in an apparently healthy patient, age continues to be a very important risk factor. Although clinical trial data are scarce for primary prevention in subjects of this age, on the basis of risk, the NCEP ATP III update recommends an optional LDL-C goal of <100 mg/dL for this patient []. If the patient were hypertensive, this recommendation would be supported by the findings of the ASCOT-LLA []. In that study, patients had a mean baseline LDL-C just over 130 mg/dL; treatment with atorvastatin 10 mg/d versus placebo led to a significant reduction in CV risk, and this effect remained apparent in patients aged over 65 years []. Likewise, were the patient to have an elevated CRP, the results of the JUPITER [] trial would have some bearing on his treatment. However, there have been no specific trials addressing patients of this type. Thus, in the absence of new recommendations, current guidelines should be followed and the patient should be treated to an LDL-C goal of <130 mg/dL or an optional goal of 100 mg/dL with an appropriate statin, titrated to goal. To reach the optional goal, it would be necessary to use a statin regimen that would allow at least a 29% reduction in LDL-C (). Consequently, a variety of options are available, including the use of generic statins.",

Heart rate >90: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n3. Respiratory rate >20 or PaCO\u2082 <32 mm Hg: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n4. White blood cell count (WBC) >12,000/mm\u00b3, <4,000/mm\u00b3, or >10% bands: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n\nThe total number of criteria met is taken by summing the score for each criteria.\n    \nThe current count of SIRS criteria met is 0.\nThe patient's temperature is 103 degrees fahrenheit. To convert to degrees celsius, apply the formula 5/9 * [temperature (degrees fahrenheit) - 32]. This means that the patient's temperature is 5/9 * 71 = 39.44444 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is greater than 38 degrees celsius, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.\nThe patient's heart rate is 120.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is greater than 90 beats per minute, this meets SIRS criteria and so we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.\nThe patient's concentration of white blood cell is 33000 count/\u00b5L. To convert 33000 count/\u00b5L of white blood cell to mm^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1.0 \u00b5L/mm^3 which will give 33000 white blood cell count/\u00b5L * 1.0 \u00b5L/mm^3 = 33000.0 white blood cell count/mm^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per mm^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 2 + 1 = 3.\nThe final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO\u2082 partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 32.0 breaths per minute, which is greater than 20 breaths per minute. The patient's PaCO\u2082 partial pressure is 41 mm Hg, which is greater or equal to than 32 mm Hg. At least one of the criteria is met, and so we increment the criteria count by 1 giving us a total of 3 + 1 = 4 criteria met.\nHence, the the number of SIRS criteria met by the patient is 4.",

        "Patient Note": "A 42-year-old female was admitted with complaints of dry cough of 5 days, high-grade fever since 15 days, generalized malaise and progressive worsening shortness of breath since 5 days. She was a nonsmoker with no history of any comorbid illness in the past. No known chemicals, fumes or occupational or allergen exposure. Upon examination, she was dyspneic, blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg and had fever of 103 F. She had a respiratory rate of 32/min, heart rate of 120 beats/min. She had no icterus, edema, clubbing, rash, skin lesions, cervical lymphadenopathy, or joint swelling. Her oxygen saturation was 74% on room air. Upon auscultation, there were fine inspiratory crepitations. Other system examinations were unremarkable. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis revealed pH of 7.47, pCO2 of 41 mmHg, and pO2 of 39 mmHg. Her leukocyte count was quite high at 33 \u00d7 103 /\u03bcL. Her sputum for acid fast-Bacilli and Gram's stain was negative. Chest radiographic findings showed inhomogeneous bilateral opacification in lower lung zones. The rest of the laboratory tests, including liver function test, kidney function test, coagulation profile, urine examination, etc., were normal.Two-dimensional echocardiography, proBNP, and electrocardiogram were normal. Work up of anti-nuclear antibodies, angiotensin converting enzyme, DsDNA antibodies, antinuclear and cytoplasmic antibodies, rheumatoid arthritis factor, extractable nuclear antigen profile, and anti-phospholipid anti bodies were negative. Blood and urine cultures were sterile. She was initially treated with noninvasive ventilation, oxygen therapy, antibiotics such as combination antibiotic regimen with pipercillin-tazobactam with and clarithromycin. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) thorax revealed bilateral diffuse confluent consolidation in lower lung zones [Figure \u2013]. Bronchoscopy followed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed (Gene XPERT real-time PCR). Molecular diagnostic test for Tuberculosis was negative; BAL galactomannan was insignificant. BAL cultures were negative. Transbronchial lung biopsy was performed from the right lower lobe, biopsy report of which came out to be AFOP [Figure and ]. She was treated with 40 mg prednisolone twice daily along with bronchodilators and oxygen therapy. Lung opacities decreased significantly after 3 days of the steroid treatment. Her ABG also improved significantly with pO2 at 92 mmHg and her saturation at 95%. She was initially on high flow oxygen mask which came down to minimum level and eventually she did not require any oxygen therapy after 5 days of steroid therapy initiation. The patient was discharged after about 10 days of hospitalization. Her review HRCT thorax showed significant improvement. She is currently on prednisolone and on regular follow-up.",

At the first consultation in the emergency department, she complained of massive abdominal pain since the night before admission, which did not respond to analgesic drugs. Because of the patient\u2019s history of bariatric surgery and the suspicion of SBO, a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, which was inconclusive at the first look with multiple differential diagnoses. It showed a thickening of the wall of the ascending colon and a diverticulum of the duodenum with semisolid contents. The patient was then referred to our hospital for further treatment.\nIn our emergency department, the patient\u2019s general condition was reduced because of pain and signs of diffuse peritonitis. The vital signs showed a blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg and an accelerated pulse (120 bpm), a respiratory rate of 25/min and a normal body temperature. The blood results showed a leukocytosis with only slightly elevated C-reactive protein (14 mg/l). The CT scan was reviewed and revealed the presence of retroperitoneal and parapancreatic fluid with some air bubbles, which could also be seen in an additional abdominal sonography. Further a thickening of the colon ascendens was found (). A perforated duodenal diverticulum was likely and suspected. The thickening of the ascending colon was interpreted as an accompanying colitis.\nAttributable to the reduced condition of the patient with little response to opioids, signs of diffuse peritonitis and our interpretation of the imaging, we decided to perform an explorative transverse laparotomy in the upper abdomen. Although the right colic flexure was mobilized, the exposure of the duodenum was difficult and very limited. However, a hard resistance could be palpated. After a Kocher maneuver and exposing the duodenum and the pancreas dorsally, we were then able to dissect the duodenal diverticulum. The diverticular wall was incised and a biliary stone of the size of ~7 \u00d7 4cm was exposed and removed (). Sutures then reattached the duodenal wall. A T-drain was placed intraduodenally, an Easy-Flow drain paraduodenally ( and ). Postoperatively, the patient was admitted to the ICU for initial surveillance. An empiric intravenous antibiotic therapy with Piperacillin/Tazobactam was initiated. After one night, the patient could be transferred to the normal ward in stable condition.\nThe postoperative course was uneventful. Pain was controlled with basis analgesia and slowly she returned to a normal diet. Inflammatory markers were declining and antibiotics could soon be stopped. Ten days postoperatively, a fistulography showed a persistent retroperitoneal collection of 3 \u00d7 3 cm so the drains were left in situ. Two days later, the patient was discharged from the hospital in proper general condition but with extraduodenal drains still in place.\nOne week after dismissal, the patient felt well with normal appetite and a regular intestinal passage. The fistulography showed a significant reduction of the collection so the T-drain was removed. Two weeks later, she still felt irritated by the last remaining Easy-Flow drainage, which continued showing some turbid liquid and was therefore left in situ. Intestinal passage was unchanged and there were no signs of inflammation. Another 2 weeks later, the drain fell out by accident. Seven weeks postoperatively, still no signs of inflammation, we were able to finish our treatment.",

        "Patient Note": "A 40-year-old (45-kg weight) previously healthy woman was admitted to the intensive burn care unit approximately 90 min after an assault chemical burn following conjugal violence. The total burned surface area was estimated at 35% (neck, face, head, arms, thorax, abdomen, and left leg), third degree []. There were severe bilateral eyes and ears lesions. Injury was due to sulfuric acid (battery acid, pH measured at 0.9). As the patient and relatives were in panic, irrigation with water was not performed at the scene of the accident but was started immediately after the arrival in the burn center. The emergency medical team began fluid resuscitation (Parkland's formula), and orotracheal intubation was performed on-site after evidence of the severity of facial burns. The patient was sedated for hospital transfer and presented the following vital signs: arterial blood pressure 70/30 mmHg, pulse 110 bpm, SpO2 >90% with normal lung auscultation. The admission electrocardiogram and chest X-ray examination did not reveal significant abnormalities. Laboratory investigations mainly revealed a profound metabolic acidosis with a pH at 6.92, PaCO2 42 mmHg, bicarbonate 8.6 mEq/l, base deficit 23.4 mEq/l, sodium 148 mEq/l, potassium 4.1 mEq/l, chloride 117 mEq/l, calcium 6.1 mg/dl, and phosphorus 15.1 mg/dl. The lactate level was within the normal range: 1.7 mmol/L. Renal function was initially preserved (serum creatinine 0.83 mg/dl), with no evidence for rhabdomyolysis. Blood coagulation tests on admission were disturbed, with fibrinogen 117 mg/dl, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) 69 s, and International Normalized Ratio (INR) 2.23. Platelets count was 169 000/mm3. Metabolic acidosis was progressively corrected by the administration of a total of 300 mmol of sodium bicarbonate over 14 h and of 140 mmol of lactate from Hartmann's solution over the first 24 h . The adjustment of the ventilator settings was complicated by the progressive development of a thoracic rigidity secondary to the chemical burns. During the ICU stay, the patient developed several complications. Mechanical ventilation was required for 40 days, and a percutaneous tracheostomy had been performed after 1 month. The hemodynamic condition required mild inotropic support (maximal dose of dobutamine, 5 \u03bcg/kg/min) for a period of 15 days. Echocardiography demonstrated a moderate alteration of the left ventricular function. While urine output was maintained during the first week, continuous venovenous hemofiltration had to be started after this interval and was continued for 7 weeks. The patients also developed multiple episodes of wound-related sepsis treated by adapted antimicrobial therapy. In addition, iterative surgery was required with a total of 15 procedures for excision and grafting. After5 months, the patient left the intensive care unit for rehabilitation.",

        "Patient Note": "A 20-year-old female, unmarried, was admitted via the emergency department of our hospital on 11th December 2013 with complaints of generalized weakness since 2 weeks, difficulty in swallowing since 2 weeks, and loose stools since 5 days. The generalized weakness was gradual in onset and more marked in legs, so much so that she was unable to rise from the bed. She also felt difficulty in swallowing and in subsequent days, difficulty even voiding urine. She also complained of loose stools 4 to 5 times a day, semisolid in consistency. No mucous and no blood was noticed. However, these were associated with occasional abdominal cramps. In systemic inquiry, she did not complain of fever, sore throat, rashes, joint pain, swelling, cough, chest pain, dysuria, hematemesis or backache. In the past history, she experienced similar episodes intermittently over the last five years. During these episodes, she used to develop generalized weakness, more of lower limbs, vomiting, and sometimes muscle cramps. With these complaints, she often visited doctors and also required admission in private hospitals, where she was given intravenous (IV) fluids with potassium and her weakness improved. Then she was discharged on potassium containing tablets which would relieve her symptoms. After recovery from the episodes, she used to discontinue oral potassium supplements. She used to remain well for 6 to 8 months before she developed another similar episode and treated similarly. In this way, she recalled 4 to 5 admissions. Record of some investigations seen showed that the predominant abnormality was low potassium level in the serum with normal renal functions. Drug history was remarkable for tablet NeoK, capsule Esomeprazole, multivitamin syrup and tablet motilium. She is the only daughter with two brothers who enjoy good health. No family history of similar disease was elicited. Parents were non-consanguineous. She studied till ninth class and then left study due to the recurrent illness. She was not addicted to narcotics. She had adequate appetite and sleep. On examination, she had short stature, lean built, and looked wasted and sick. Her pulse was 88 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP), 90/60 mm Hg, temperature, 98.6\u00b0F and respiratory rate, 20 breaths per minute. She was not pale looking, icteric or cyanosed. No koilonychia or clubbing was noted. Dehydration was positive, and muscles were wasted. Her abdomen was soft, non tender, with palpable bladder but no other visceromegaly. The chest was clear. Both heart sounds were audible in all four areas. No added sounds were noted. In central nervous system (CNS) examination, Glasgow coma scale (GCS) was 15/15; power was 3/5 in both lower limbs, 4/5 in upper limbs with intact sensation. Deep tendon reflexes were diminished in all 4 limbs. A clinical differential of malabsorption, periodic hypokalemic paralysis, or salt-losing nephropathy was contemplated. On laboratory investigations, serum urea was 73 mg/dl; creatinine, 1.72 mg/dl; sodium, 127 mEq/L; potassium, 1.4 mEq/L; chloride, 101 mEq/L; and bicarbonate, 9 mEq/L. Her hemogram showed hemoglobin (Hb) of 15.1 g/dl; total leucocyte count (TLC), 37.4\u00d7109/L; and platelets, 494\u00d7109/L. Urine analysis revealed pH of 7.00; pus cells, occasional; and red blood cells (RBCs), numerous. Further biochemical tests showed serum calcium, 6.4 mg/dl; phosphorus, 3.2 mg/dl; serum albumin, 1.8 g/dl; total bilirubin, 0.86 mg/dl; direct bilirubin, 0.08 mg/dl; alkaline phosphatase, 50 IU/L; serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), 14 IU/L; serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), 6 IU/L; and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), 7 IU/L. Ultrasound abdomen showed both sided normal size kidneys with mild pelvicalyceal dilatation bilaterally. Bladder was distended with approximate volume of 430 ml. Chest X-ray was done, which was unremarkable (). Electrocardiography done showed flattening of T waves with occasional inversion in some leads, findings typically seen in hypokalemia (). She was catheterized, rehydrated with isotonic saline with KCL, and IV antibiotics started on suspicion of urinary tract infection (UTI) as TLC was high. She maintained good urinary output (>1500 ml). By admission day 5, diarrhea had settled. Repeat laboratory tests at this time showed: serum urea of 47 mg/dl; creatinine, 1.6 mg/dl; potassium, 2.5 mEq/L and sodium, 127 mEq/L. Further investigations showed serum magnesium of 1.02 mg/dl. IV magnesium sulphate was administered daily with modest elevation in serum levels during subsequent days. Potassium requirement remained high and was administered by oral and IV routes. On admission day 10, her serum creatinine was 0.85 mg/dl; potassium, 2.6 mEq/L; and magnesium, 0.95 mg/dl. The temporal changes in serum magnesium and potassium are shown in . The 24-h urinary metabolic study on day 10th of admission showed potassium, 44 mmol/24h; magnesium, 50 mg/ 24 h; calcium, 108 mg/24 h (normal range: 100 to 300 mg/24 h). Fractional excretion of magnesium was 27.3%. In the face of low serum magnesium, fractional magnesium excretion should be less than 2%. Her gastrointestinal (GI) workup was also done including upper GI endoscopy and sigmoidoscopy. Upper GI endoscopy revealed normal mucosa, with mild antral erythema. Sigmoidoscopy showed normal mucosa. Tissue biopsies were also obtained. The duodenal biopsy showed mild stunting of villi with slightly increased intraepithelial lymphocytes; the antrum showed mild chronic nonspecific gastritis and the rectosigmoid, mild nonspecific colitis. Anti-trangultaminase antibodies and anti-deamidated gliadin-derived peptide antibodies were negative. Final diagnosis was made of GS along with changes of tropical sprue on duodenal biopsy. Genetic testing could not be done due to non-availability of the test.She was discharged on third January 2014 on tablet spironolactone 25 mg, once daily, increased subsequently to 50 mg; tablet Neok, 2 tablets, 8-hourly, capsule magnesium chloride 1 capsule, 8-hourly, tablet folic acid 5 mg, once daily, tablet Ciproxin 250 mg, 12-hourly.",

        "Patient Note": "A 20-year-old male presented with a 2-month history of on and off swelling of both legs and sudden onset weakness of all 4 limbs without any history of loss of consciousness, seizure, headache, sensory loss, or bowel and bladder involvement. There was no history of such a weakness. Additionally, there was no history of dryness of the mouth and eyes (suggestive of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome), no joint pain, oral ulcers, hair loss, or photosensitivity (suggestive of lupus). A neurological examination revealed normal cranial nerves and higher mental functions. Power in the upper and lower limbs was 2/5 and 1/5, respectively.

        "Patient Note": "A 40-year-old woman presented with general weakness, nausea, vomiting, numbness, and weight loss of 8 kg over the previous two months. The patient was 154 cm tall and weighed 57 kg. Her blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg and pulse was 110 beats/min. She was on no diuretics or other medications. She did not have a medical history or diarrhea upon presentation. On admission, she had weakness in both limbs (Medical Research Council Grade 2), but her deep-tendon reflexes were intact. Babinski's sign and ankle clonus were absent.Upon initial laboratory analysis, her sodium was 142.8 mEq/L; potassium, 2.3 mEq/L; chloride, 125.5 mEq/L; calcium, 7.7 mg/dL; phosphorus, 1.1 mg/dL; magnesium, 2.6 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 17.7 mg/dL; creatinine, 1.0 mg/dL; 7.5, bicarbonate; and albumin, 4.2 g/dL. Her spot urine potassium was 16.9 mEq/L, and the transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG) was 7%, suggesting renal loss. Blood gas analysis revealed a pH of 7.194, PCO2 of 19.5 mmHg, PO2 of 67.8 mmHg, and SpO2 of 90.2%, suggesting metabolic acidosis. Urinalysis revealed a pH of 6.5 and a urine anion gap of 6.1. Due to the patient's hypotension and altered mental status, she was admitted to the intensive care unit. She required mechanical ventilatory support with supplemental oxygen due to lethargy, somnolence, and respiratory failure (PCO2 45.3 mmHg). She was treated with intravenous potassium chloride and an oral potassium chloride tablet via nasogastric tube. In addition to ventilatory support, she also required treatment for her severe acidemia with sodium bicarbonate. Her desired bicarbonate level was 24 mEq, and her bicarbonate deficit was calculated to be 365 mEq from the following formula: bicarbonate deficit = (0.5 \u00d7 lean body weight) \u00d7 (24- serum bicarbonate) []. Her lean body weight was calculated to be 44.5 kg from the following formula: lean body weight [kg] = 9270 \u00d7 body weight [kg]/6680 + (216 x BMI [kg/m2]). We treated her with an overdose of 480 mEq of intravenous sodium bicarbonate in 5% dextrose and water solution because her mental status and severe metabolic acidosis did not improve. The next day, her potassium was corrected to normal levels (4.2 mEq/L). However, we found acute hypernatremia with her sodium levels rising from 142.8 mEq/L to 172.8 mEq/L. We began treating her with half-normal saline and 5% dextrose in water, and her serum sodium level gradually decreased from 172.8 mEq/L to 148.0 mEq/L over the course of six days (Figure ). As her hypernatremia was corrected, she became more alert and her weakness was greatly improved.Six days after the development of hypernatremia, several other symptoms became evident including dysarthria, drooling, difficulty swallowing, and tetraparesis. Because of these symptoms, we suspected ODS associated with acute hypernatremia. Consistent with our clinical suspicion, a brain MRI revealed symmetric, high-intensity signal in the central pons with sparing of the peripheral portion, suggesting CPM (Figure ). Soon after this diagnostic confirmation of CPM, two consecutive therapeutic plasma exchange sessions for two days were started with a total of 4394 mL plasma exchanged with albumin 5%, crystalloids, and fresh frozen plasma. The day following the plasma exchange, she regained speech and became oriented. Her neurological symptoms, which included dysarthria, difficulty swallowing, and tetraparesis, were markedly improved, but mild diplopia was present.After the patient was stabilized, we were able to work her up to explore the primary cause of her presenting symptoms. We suspected distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA) due to the normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, a serum bicarbonate level < 10, hypokalemia, and urine pH of 6.5 (> 5.5), and due to the presence of a calyceal stone in her left kidney. We performed a sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) loading test to confirm distal RTA []. In NaHCO3 loading test, 8.4% NaHCO3 solution was infused intravenously at a rate of 57 mEq/hour (1 mEq/kg/hour). Urine and blood samples were taken at 1-hour intervals and urine and blood PCO2 were measured using a blood gas analyzer. When the urine pH was raised to 7.6, urine PCO2, blood PCO2, urine HCO3, blood HCO3, urine creatinine and serum creatinine were 44.5 mmHg, 34.8 mmHg, 40.1 mEq/L, 25.8 mEq/L, 64.5 mg/dL, and 0.7 mg/dL, respectively. The results of NaHCO3 loading test revealed a fractionated excretion of HCO3 of 1.68% and the urine-to-blood carbon dioxide tension gradient (U-B PCO2) of 9.7, suggesting distal RTA. In addition to the distal RTA, we also found that she had Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome after the results of Schirmer\u2019s test and after she screened positive for anti-Lo and anti-Ra, which was confirmed by a salivary scan and lower lip biopsy. She was discharged and treated at an outpatient clinic with oral sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride. After one year of follow-up, her neurological symptoms were improved, but mild diplopia remained.",

Hence, we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 67.\nCerebrovascular disease history is determined to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 67.\nRenal Disease History is determined to be present for the patient and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 67 + 10 = 77.\nAltered Mental Status is determined to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 77.\nPleural effusion on x-ray is not reported for the patient and so we assume it to be false. Hence, we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 77.\nThe patient's pulse is 90.0 beats per minute. The pulse is less than 125 beats per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping it at 77.\nThe patient's temperature is 37.1 degrees celsius. The patient's temperature is greater than 35 degrees celsius and the temperature is less than 39.9 degrees celsius, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 77.\nThe patient's pH is 7.37. The patient's pH is greater than or equal to 7.35, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the current total at 77.\nThe patient's respiratory rate is 19.0 breaths per minute. The patient's respiratory rate is less than 30 breaths per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total score at 77.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 120.0 mm Hg. The patient's systolic blood pressure is greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 77.\nThe concentration of BUN is 21 mg/dL. The patient's BUN is less than 30 mg/dL, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 77.\nThe concentration of sodium is 138.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 138.0 mEq. To convert from 138.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 138.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 138.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 138.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 138.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 138.0 mmol sodium/L. The patient's sodium is greater than or equal to 130 mmol/L, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 77.\nThe concentration of glucose is 179.0 mg/dL. The patient's glucose concentration is less than or equal to than 250 mg/dL, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 77.\nThe patient's hematocrit is 40.0 %. The patient's hematocrit is greater than or equal to 30%, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 77.\nThe patient's partial pressure of oxygen is 79.0 mm Hg. The patient's partial pressure of oxygen is greater than or equal to 60 mm Hg, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 77.\nThe patient's PSI score is 77.",

        "Patient Note": "A 67-year-old female resident of a nursing home presented to the emergency department with complaints of worsening shortness of breath, productive cough with greenish sputum, and fatigue over the past week. She also described experiencing intermittent fevers and some mild pleuritic chest pain that worsens with deep breaths. Her medical history is marked by chronic kidney disease, for which she receives routine follow-up. She denies any history of cerebrovascular incidents, neoplastic disease, or significant liver diseases.On examination, the patient appeared mildly dyspneic but was communicative and oriented. Initial vital signs were recorded as follows: heart rate of 90 beats per minute, systolic blood pressure of 120 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and a temperature of 37.1 degrees Celsius. Pulse oximetry indicated a partial pressure of oxygen of 79 mm Hg on room air. Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular heart rhythm without any murmurs, gallops, or rubs. Peripheral examination did not show any evidence of edema or jugular venous distension.The respiratory examination identified decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion at the lung bases bilaterally, with scattered crackles heard predominantly over the lower lobes. Her abdomen was soft, non-tender, with no organomegaly noted. Neurological examination indicated no focal deficits, and the patient demonstrated no signs of altered mental status.Laboratory investigations revealed a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 21 mg/dL, consistent with her known renal disease, and a sodium level of 138 mEq/L. Her hematocrit was 40%, and the serum glucose level was elevated at 179 mg/dL. Arterial blood gas analysis taken on room air showed a pH of 7.37, indicating no significant acid-base disturbances.Given her clinical presentation and risk factors, a chest x-ray was performed and identified multiple infiltrates suggestive of pneumonia. Despite not exhibiting any new or pronounced systemic signs or significant decompensation linked to her renal pathology at this moment, careful consideration was given to her underlying health conditions.Based on her clinical findings, laboratory results, and imaging studies, a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia was made. The patient was started on appropriate antibiotics and provided supplemental oxygen as clinically indicated. Given her underlying chronic conditions and the presence of nursing home-associated factors, the multidisciplinary team recommended continuous inpatient management to closely monitor her respiratory status, hemodynamics, and renal function. Further interventions were planned to address the acute infection and prevent potential complications.",

        "Patient Note": "A 62-year-old male was brought to the emergency department by his daughter after he was found unresponsive in his living room. According to her, the patient had been experiencing worsening confusion and lethargy over the past 48 hours, but there were no prior complaints of dizziness, headache, fever, or trauma. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypertension, with his medication regimen including albuterol, tiotropium, and losartan.Upon arrival at the emergency department, the patient was unresponsive to both verbal commands and physical nudging. He did not exhibit any verbal communication or make any sounds despite multiple stimulus attempts. However, his eyes were noted to be open and moving spontaneously without a clear focus on any particular object or person in the room.During the physical examination, when a painful stimulus was applied to his nail bed, the patient exhibited abnormal posturing by flexing his arms towards his body. There were no signs of defensive reactions to pain or purposeful movements observed. Vital signs at presentation included a blood pressure of 145/92 mmHg, a heart rate of 105 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. The patient's pupils were equal and reactive to light with a size of 3 mm bilaterally, and his skin appeared warm but pale. The cardiovascular examination revealed a regular heart rhythm sans murmurs or additional sounds, while lung auscultation demonstrated decreased breath sounds consistent with underlying COPD, but without acute wheezing or rales present.Abdominal examination was benign, with no tenderness, guarding, or palpable masses. Extremities were free of edema, exhibited normal pulses, and there were no signs of trauma or injuries indicative of a fall or other accidents.Given the patient\u2019s sudden unresponsiveness, several potential differential diagnoses were considered including metabolic encephalopathy, toxicologic exposure, or a cerebrovascular event. Initial bedside glucose testing showed a normal result. Immediate diagnostics included a non-contrast CT scan of the head to identify any acute intracranial pathology, including hemorrhage or infarction, as well as comprehensive blood analyses encompassing a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, liver function tests, and a toxicology screen.Throughout the evaluation, the medical team ensured the patient\u2019s airway remained protected due to his altered mental status. Continuous monitoring of his vitals and neurological status was maintained in the emergency department. The patient's daughter provided additional information, confirming that he had no known substance abuse history and was medication-compliant as per her knowledge.Given the critical nature of his presentation, preparations were made for possible escalation of care, including potential admission to the intensive care unit depending on the results of the imaging and laboratory studies. The daughter's cooperation was essential for collecting further medical history data and supporting logistics related to his care.",

Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS): 1-15 points (use 15 - [GCS Score])\n\nThe total APACHE II score is calculated by summing the points for each criterion.\n    \nThe patient's current APACHE II score is 0 points.\nThe patient is 64 years old. Because the patient's age is between 55 and 64, 3 points are added to the total, making the current total, 0 + 3 = 3.\nThe patient is reported to not have any organ failure immunocompromise and so 0 points are added to the total, keeping the total at 3 points.\nThe patient's FiO2 percentage is 36.0%.\nBecause the patient's FiO\u2082 percentage is less than 50%, we need to examine the patient's partial pressure of oxygen (PaO\u2082) to compute the APACHE II score. The patient's PaO\u2082 is 75.0 mm Hg. Because the patient's PaO\u2082 is greater than 70 mm Hg, we do not add any points to the total, keeping the current total at 3.\nThe patient's temperature is 100.8 degrees fahrenheit. To convert to degrees celsius, apply the formula 5/9 * [temperature (degrees fahrenheit) - 32]. This means that the patient's temperature is 5/9 * 68.8 = 38.22222 degrees celsius. \nBecause the patient's temperature is between 36 and 38.5 degrees celsius, no points are added to the score, keeping the current total at 3.\nThe mean average pressure is computed by the formula 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure) + 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure). Plugging in the values, we get 1/3 * 110.0 mm Hg + 2/3 * 58.0 mm Hg = 75.33333 mm Hg.\nHence, the patient's mean arterial pressure is 75.33333 mm Hg.Because the patient's mean arterial pressure is between 70 and 109 mmHg, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 3.\nThe patient's heart rate is 107.0 beats per minute.\nBecause the patient's heart rate is between 70 and 109 beats per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 3.\nThe patient's respiratory rate is 22.0 breaths per minute.\nBecause the patient's respiratory rate is between 12 and 24 breaths per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 3.\nThe patient's pH is 7.29.\nBecause the patient's pH is between 7.25 and 7.32, 2 points are added to the score, making the current total 3 + 2 = 5.\nThe concentration of sodium is 136 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 136 mEq. To convert from 136 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 136 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 136 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 136.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 136 mEq sodium/L converts to 136.0 mmol sodium/L. Because the patient's sodium level is between 130 and 149 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 5.\nThe concentration of potassium is 4.5 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of potassium from mEq to mmol. The mass of potassium is 4.5 mEq. To convert from 4.5 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 4.5 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 4.5 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 4.5 mmol potassium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 4.5 mEq potassium/L converts to 4.5 mmol potassium/L. Because the patient's potassium level is between 3.5 and 5.4 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 5.\nThe concentration of creatinine is 1.8 mg/dL. The patient is determined to have an acute renal failure.\nThe patient is determined to not have a chronic renal failure.\nBecause the patient has acute renal failure and a creatinine level between 1.5 and 2.0, 4 points are added to the score, making the current total 5 + 4 = 9.\nThe patient has a hematocrit of 34.0%.\nBecause the patient's hematocrit is between 30% and 45%, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 9.\nThe patient's concentration of white blood cell count is 12300.0 count/mm^3. To convert 12300.0 count/mm^3 of white blood cell count to L, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000.0 mm^3/L which will give 12300.0 white blood cell count count/mm^3 * 1000000.0 mm^3/L = 12300000000.0 white blood cell count count/L. Because the patient's white blood cell count is at least 3x10^9/L, but less than 15 x10^9/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 9.\nThe patient's Glasgow Coma Score is 13. For this criterion, we subtract 15 from the 13 points and add that to the total score. 15 - 13 = 2. Hence, we add 2 to the total making the current total 2 + 9 = 11.\nHence, the patient's APACHE II score is 11.",

        "Patient Note": "A 64-year-old female presented to the emergency department with complaints of difficulty in breathing, palpitations, and general weakness for the past 48 hours. The patient also reported experiencing chills and a feverish sensation since the onset of symptoms. She denied any past history of organ failure and confirmed that she has not been diagnosed with any condition that would compromise her immune system. Upon arrival, the patient appeared to be in moderate respiratory distress. She was febrile with a temperature of 100.8 degrees Fahrenheit. Her heart rate was elevated at 107 beats per minute, and she exhibited a rapid respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. Blood pressure measurement revealed a systolic pressure of 110 mm Hg and a diastolic pressure of 58 mm Hg. The patient was on supplemental oxygen with an FiO2 of 36%, and arterial blood gas analysis indicated a PaO2 of 75 mm Hg. Laboratory investigations were undertaken immediately. Serum electrolyte levels showed sodium of 136 mEq/L and potassium of 4.5 mEq/L. Renal function tests revealed a creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dL, concerning for acute renal impairment, though she had no history of chronic kidney disease. Hematological tests indicated a hematocrit of 34% and a white blood cell count of 12,300/mm^3, suggesting a possible inflammatory or infectious process. Her blood pH was recorded at 7.29, indicative of mild acidemia. A thorough physical examination noted that her abdominal examination was unremarkable and there were no focal neurologic deficits. However, auscultation of her chest revealed decreased breath sounds bilaterally without wheezes or crackles. She was fully conscious and oriented, with a Glasgow Coma Score of 13 points. Given her clinical presentation and laboratory findings, she was suspected to be in the early stages of sepsis, likely secondary to a respiratory infection, complicated by acute renal dysfunction. In light of these findings and the risk of further deterioration, she was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and advanced supportive care. An emergency surgical consultation was obtained to evaluate the necessity for immediate intervention, although at the moment, her condition did not demonstrate an immediate need for surgery. Close monitoring of her vital signs, renal function, and respiratory status was initiated. A chest X-ray and relevant cultures were obtained to identify the source of infection. She was initiated on empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics and required close multidisciplinary team management involving the intensive care unit, internal medicine, and nephrology departments. In conclusion, the patient presented with significant respiratory distress, fever, tachycardia, and signs of acute renal dysfunction. The clinical and laboratory evaluations were consistent with a systemic inflammatory response, potentially due to an infectious etiology, necessitating intensive monitoring and appropriate supportive care. The patient's immediate focus was stabilization and further diagnostic investigations to guide targeted treatment.",

The patient is reported to be using continuous positive airway pressure. Because the patient's partial pressure of oxygen to FiO\u2082 ratio is between 100 to 199, and the patient is using at least one of (i) mechanical ventillation or (ii) continious positive airway pressure, we increase the score by three points, makeing the current total 0 + 3 = 3.\nFor two points to be given, the patient must be taking less than or equal to 5 micrograms/kg/min or any amount of dobutamine.

        "Patient Note": "A 67-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), type 2 diabetes, and known hypotension presented to the emergency department with complaints of progressive shortness of breath, confusion, and generalized weakness over the past 48 hours. His wife noted that he had been less responsive and had difficulty communicating over the last day. She also reported a decline in his oral intake and energy levels. Upon arrival, he appeared severely dyspneic, cyanotic, and unable to complete sentences due to breathlessness. His vital signs included a markedly low blood pressure of 78/46 mm Hg, a heart rate of 95 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 88% on high-flow nasal cannula. He was placed on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) immediately due to his labored breathing and hypoxemia. His initial arterial blood gas analysis showed a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) at 79 mm Hg while receiving an inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) of 52%. During the physical examination, crackles were auscultated throughout both lung fields, indicative of pulmonary involvement. Cardiovascular assessment revealed tachycardia but no abnormal heart sounds. Peripheral pulses were faint and difficult to palpate, and there was no peripheral edema. His skin was cool, clammy, and exhibited delayed capillary refill, strongly suggestive of poor perfusion. Neurologically, the patient was drowsy but arousable, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13, indicating confusion consistent with his described mental status. He had difficulty maintaining attention, but there were no focal neurological deficits. Laboratory results were significant for thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 147,000/\u00b5L. His liver function tests indicated elevated bilirubin at 1.6 mg/dL. Renal function studies revealed a serum creatinine of 1.7 mg/dL, mildly elevated from baseline, and his reported urine output was notably reduced to 650 mL over the past 24 hours, raising concern for early renal hypoperfusion. Given his persistent hypotension and overt signs of circulatory shock, vasopressor support was immediately indicated. A low-dose DOPamine infusion at 5 mcg/kg/min was initiated to maintain hemodynamic stability. Given the clinical presentation, initial differential diagnoses included severe exacerbation of COPD potentially complicated by an infection. Blood and sputum cultures, along with comprehensive metabolic panels, were conducted to identify any underlying infectious processes. Chest radiography showed bilateral infiltrates suggestive of pneumonia or an infectious exacerbation of his COPD. The patient's blood glucose was closely monitored due to his diabetes, with adjustments made to maintain optimal levels. Additionally, broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated empirically while awaiting culture results. He was admitted to the intensive care unit for close monitoring and advanced management, including respiratory support measures and tight hemodynamic control. Pulmonologists and intensivists were consulted to contribute to his care plan, focusing on optimizing his respiratory function and addressing potential infectious causes. The patient's progress was closely monitored, with a care strategy aiming to stabilize his acute condition while mitigating any further deterioration.",

        "Patient Note": "A 67-year-old male presents to the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath and productive cough persisting for the past week. The patient notes that his symptoms have gradually worsened, despite taking over-the-counter medications. His BMI was 21 kg/m2. He admits to feeling generally unwell with fatigue and decreased appetite over the same period. He has been more sedentary due to his ill health, and has been in bed for the past 4 days. The patient's medical history is significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diagnosed five years ago. He uses prescribed bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids regularly but notes increased shortness of breath and cough over the past month. Additionally, he was diagnosed with pneumonia approximately two weeks ago, for which he received outpatient antibiotic therapy. He believes he is not recovering as expected and expresses concern about his respiratory symptoms. During the physical examination, it was noted that the patient has prominent varicose veins affecting his lower extremities, which he says have been symptomatic for several years. His legs appear to be unaffected by swelling at this time. He denies any history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).The patient mentions that his family has a history of thrombosis, specifically his father, who experienced multiple thrombotic events. However, he himself has not been tested for any specific thrombophilic conditions like Factor V Leiden or prothrombin gene mutations. His mobility is currently normal aside from the immobility caused by his recent hip fracture.Furthermore, the patient has no recent history of acute myocardial infarction and affirms that he has never been diagnosed with any malignancies. He denies having a history of inflammatory bowel disease and states he has never used a central venous access device. Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. On examination, his lung fields show crackles bilaterally, consistent with his recent pneumonia diagnosis. Cardiovascular examination is unremarkable with no murmurs, and his abdomen is soft with no hepatosplenomegaly.Given his recent pneumonia, history of COPD, current hip fracture, and family history of thrombosis, the patient is assessed for risk factors related to venous thromboembolism (VTE). He is provided with guidance on the importance of mobility, pulmonary rehabilitation exercises, and adherence to his COPD treatment regimen. Given his increased risk, prophylactic anticoagulation therapy is considered pending further evaluation and consultation with his primary care physician. The patient is advised to follow up promptly with his healthcare provider to ensure monitoring and management of his symptoms and any potential complications. He is also educated on the signs and symptoms of thromboembolic events and instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they occur.",

To convert to mme/day of FentaNYL buccal, multiply the 20 \u00b5g/day by the mme conversion factor, 0.13 mme/\u00b5g, giving us 2.6 mme/day. Adding the mme/day of FentaNYL buccal to the total mme/day gives us 30 + 2.6 = 32.6 mme/day.\nThe patient's dose of Morphine is 50 mg. The patient takes 1 doses/day of Morphine. This means that the patient takes 50 mg/dose Morphine * 1 dose/day = 50 mg/day. To convert to mme/day of Morphine, multiply the 50 mg/day by the mme conversion factor, 1 mme/mg, giving us 50 mme/day. Adding the mme/day of Morphine to the total mme/day gives us 32.6 + 50 = 82.6 mme/day.\nThe patient's mme/day is 82.6 mme/day.",
