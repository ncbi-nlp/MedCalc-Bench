        "Patient Note": "A 66-year-old Japanese male was admitted to the authors\u2019 hospital for fever and abdominal pain. He had a past history of multiple renal cysts, chronic renal failure on chronic hemodialysis for 2 years, and multiple liver cysts due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). He showed the relapse of infection of liver cysts and received longtime antibiotics therapies.\nOn admission, his vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 39.4 \u00b0C; heart rate, 101 beats per minutes (bpm); and respiratory rate, 20 bpm. Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7480 cells/mm3 with a high neutrophil count of 90.7%, and a C reactive protein of 18.08 mg/dl. He was diagnosed as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) showed an abnormal high intensity at the multiple liver cysts, indicating that polycystic infection was strongly suspected. Although antibiotic therapy with intravenous meropenem at a dose of 0.5 g/day was started, fever and inflammatory reactions were unable to improve. Therefore, percutaneous echo-guided drainage was introduced for the most accumulated liver cyst. Because of the improvements of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, the drainage tube was removed at 19 days after drainage. However, the low-grade fever and inflammatory reactions recurred, and the discontinuation of antibiotic therapy was difficult. Because the most of the liver showed multilocular cystic changes, the control of infection was considered to be difficult by conservative treatments such as a local drainage or a partial liver resection, and the severe infection was expected to be repeated in the future.\nAs a fundamental treatment, a surgical approach was considered to be necessary, and a liver transplantation surgery was considered to be an indication for the disease. Therefore, he was planned to undergo living-donor liver transplantation with a right lobe graft from his wife. The graft was selected with considering a graft-to-recipient weight ratio of 0.88%, which is larger than the minimal recommended ratio of 0.8%.\nBefore the liver transplantation, he was 168.0 cm tall and weighed 68 kg. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly extending below the level of the umbilicus. Laboratory data showed anemia (Hb 10.4 g/dL), and the elevation of C-reactive protein (2.61 mg/dL). Liver and renal profiles were as follows: total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 17 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 10 U/L; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.3; creatinine, 5.09 mg/dL. His Child-Pugh score was 7 (grade B), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 22. Arterial blood gas analysis showed that blood pH was 7.44, PaCO2 32.9 mmHg, PaO2, 82.1 mmHg in room air, and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient (A-aDO2) was increased to 26.8 mmHg. Chest X-ray revealed an elevation of right diaphragm. Computed tomography (CT) showed hepatomegaly with multiple liver cysts, multiple renal cysts, mild ascites, and no abnormal findings in the lung (Fig. ). Respiratory function test showed the forced vital capacity (FVC) was mildly reduced down to 72% of predicted value, and the adjusted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLco) by Cotes\u2019 method was moderately reduced down to 57.8% of predicted value. Venous ultrasonography revealed lower extremity venous thrombosis, and the day before the operation, an inferior vena cava filter was inserted by a right internal-jugular-vein approach without any complications. At 114 days after admission, a living related liver transplantation was performed. After endotracheal intubation, two central venous catheters were inserted from left and right internal jugular veins before surgery without any complications.\nGeneral anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. The artificial ventilation was uneventful, and the airway pressure was kept below 30 cmH2O during the intraoperative period.\nThe abdominal cavity was reached through the upper abdominal reverse-T incision. The liver was found to swell markedly and to push the right diaphragm upward. Although the liver was firmly adhered to the right diaphragm, the adhesion was sharply dissected by electrocautery under appropriate traction. After the extraction of the liver, the right diaphragm was found to swell markedly and occupy the abdominal cavity. Although there was no significant change in the vital signs, the right pneumothorax was suspected, a thoracic drain was immediately inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and continuous drainage was initiated. However, the right diaphragm distended by a massive air leak and prevented the operators from anastomosing the liver vessels and the bile duct. Therefore, a small relaxing incision was made in the right diaphragm for depressurizing the right thoracic cavity and making an adequate operative field to anastomose. Thoracoscopic observation was performed through the diaphragm incision. There was no adhesion in the right thoracic cavity, and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the right lung was widely expanded like a giant cyst due to dissection from the lung parenchyma, and a marked air leak was recognized from a pin hole in the dissected pleura. Since controlling the air leakage in the patient was considered difficult only by drainage, a leakage closure operation was decided to be performed after the completion of the liver transplantation. Following the transplantation procedure, the thoracoscopic leakage closure operation was performed for the patient in the supine position.\nDuring operation, a thoracoscope was inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and endoscopic surgical instruments were inserted through the small diaphragm incision (Fig. ). The expanded visceral pleura was incised by electrocautery to drain air and pooled blood in the cyst, and bleeding sites in the lung parenchyma were identified and controlled by electric coagulation. Because the lung parenchyma and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the lung was widely dissected and the base of the cyst was large, cystectomy was found to be difficult to be performed by a stapler or sutures. For controlling the air leakage, absorbable fibrin sealant patches (TachoSil\u00ae, Baxtor Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA) were patched on the lung parenchyma under dissected visceral pleura, and fibrin glue (Beriplast P\u00ae, CSL Behring, Tokyo, Japan) was injected into the dissected space. After no air pooling was confirmed under the visceral pleura with positive pressure ventilation, polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets (Neoveil\u00ae, Gunze, Kyoto) were applied, and fibrin glue was sprayed on the visceral pleura surface (Fig. ). Finally, a 21Fr silicone thoracic tube was inserted through the right 10th intercostal space and placed on the apex of right thoracic cavity, and the diaphragm and abdominal incision was closed. Although a postoperative minor air leakage was observed, chest X-ray showed the complete expansion of the right lung. The patient was treated with water seal drainage. After the air leakage disappeared, the drainage tube was removed at 27 days after surgery. The course after liver transplantation was also smooth, and he was discharged at 67 days after surgery. The cyst on the bottom of the right lung was confirmed to disappear on chest CT after discharge (Fig. ).",

        "Patient Note": "A 62-year-old man was admitted to the neurology department complaining of an inability to see in the right eye for 2 days along with acute headache. He had a history of atrial fibrillation in rheumatic heart disease and suffered an ischaemic stroke in the left frontotemporal parietal lobe 4 years ago. The right limb of the patient was left with sequelae of mild paralysis, and he gradually developed mild vascular dementia; however, he could communicate with family members normally in daily life. He suffered symptomatic epilepsy due to ischaemic stroke 2 years ago, and effective antiepileptic drugs (500 mg levetiracetam bid and 500 mg valproic acid bid) were prescribed. At the first medical evaluation, the arterial pressure was 170/100 mmHg, and arterial blood lactic acid was 3.3 mmol/L. Liver function, renal function, electrolytes, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, procalcitonin, cerebrospinal fluid examination, syphilis antibody and HIV testing were normal. Neurological examination revealed a cognitive decline wherein the patient could not accurately answer questions or simply reply with short sentences or words. Ophthalmological examination found that when the patient\u2019s eyes were unshielded, he needed to walk with help to distinguish orientations. Neither eye of the patient could read a visual chart clearly, but he could grasp a pen when shaken in front of both eyes, suggesting macular avoidance or partial visual field avoidance. The patient suffered sudden visual impairment, acute headache and progressive dementia, which suggested that the lesion may be located in the cerebral cortex. An MRI was then performed, which showed marked diffuse cortical hyperintensities in the left temporoparietal and occipital lobes on T2 and diffusion-weighted images. The apparent diffusion coefficient map demonstrated decreased signal intensity in the area of interest compared with the control region. Thus, the lesion was identified, while the differential diagnosis was relatively difficult. The patient had rheumatic heart disease and atrial fibrillation, which were risk factors for arterial cerebral infarction. However, CT angiography did not find corresponding vascular occlusion, and the lesion was not consistent with the vascular distribution. Thus, arterial cerebral infarction was excluded. The patient did not have drug or poison contact. Liver function, kidney function and plasma glucose were normal. Metabolism or toxic encephalopathy was less possible. Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) was another possible diagnosis, as it could present with similar symptoms and the elevated blood pressure obtained at admission. However, the lesion was located on one side of the cortex, and the focus was a cytotoxic brain oedema. RPLS was less likely because its focus is often vasogenic oedema and symmetric. The lesion was located in the cortex of the left temporoparietal occipital lobes, and the lactate level was increased at admission. MELAS could not be completely ruled out. However, the patient did not have exercise intolerance in the past and had a rather older age. We found that the lactic acid level was normal. These clinical data did not suggest a diagnosis of MELAS. One day after hospitalization, the patient suffered limb twitches of the right lower limb lasting for approximately 1 min., and his wife told us that the patient was more taciturn than he had been in the past week, which she ignored at the beginning. Consequently, continuous EEG monitoring was performed, which found continuous sharp wave discharges, especially in the regions of the left temporal, parietal and occipital lobes. The patient had a history of epilepsy, acute headache, and visual and cognitive impairment. MRI found cytotoxic brain oedema in the left temporoparietal and occipital lobes, and EEG found sharp waves discharges mainly in the regions of the left central, parietal and occipital lobes. Taken together, these findings were most consistent with NCSE. Continuous intravenous administration of diazepam and oral addition of the antiepileptic drug topiramate (50 mg bid) were prescribed. After that, the patient recovered quickly, and follow-up EEG monitoring was normal. A follow-up MRI was performed 11 days later, which showed that the abnormal signal of the left parietooccipital occipital lobes was markedly attenuated (Fig. ). We concluded that the abnormal and reversible imaging on the MRI was TPMA.",

The complaints had not decreased over the last 20 days despite the patient using different types of antibiotics. His general physical appearance was pale and exhausted. He had subfebrile fever of 37.5\u2103 and blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg. Physical examination revealed bilaterally reduced pulmonary sounds at the mid and lower zones with bilateral crepitations which were heard more in the right lung. Abdominal examination was normal without hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory findings showed leukocyte of 38,470/mm3(consisted of 92% neutrophil, 4.2% lymphocyte, 2.1% monocyte, and 1.5% eosinophil), hemoglobin of 14.3 g/dL, platelet of 437,000/\u00b5L and C-reactive protein of 120 mg/dL. Posteroanterior chest x-ray showed extensive infiltration in the mid and lower zones of the right lung with a round-shaped air-filled lesion (). Thoracic ultrasonography confirmed the presence of bronchogram in the lower zone of the right lung as a pneumonic consolidation. The possibility of abscess was excluded. Ampicillin/sulbactam in combination with amikasin was started. On the third day of treatment, the patient developed a confused state of mind together with tachypnea (60 times per minute), dyspnea, tachycardia (130 beats per minute), hypoxemia (oxygen saturation <90% under nasal oxygen flow at the rate of 6 L/min), and hypotension (75/40 mmHg). The patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit. Considering possible shock status due to staphylococcal pneumonia, an aggressive intravenous fluid regimen and a change in antibiotic treatment to vancomycin and meropenem were started. Respiratory distress did not improve despite intensive application of inhaled \u03b22 mimetic, inhaled corticosteroid and intravenous corticosteroid. The patient's immunity showed resistance to medical therapy and was clinically unstable. Since our hospital was lacking high-resolution computed tomography facility, the high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) examination could not be performed emergently.\nIn this case, HRCT examination was performed after stabilization of the patient, it showed a lobulated, 9 cm \u00d7 7 cm \u00d7 7-cm lesion with cavitation in the superior segment of the lower lobe of the right lung indicating a ruptured hydatid cyst (). The diagnosis of anaphylaxis due to ruptured hydatid cyst was confirmed. Medical history also showed that the patient had experienced expectoration of cystic fluid together with an acute attack of severe cough just 30 minutes before the onset of shock status. A repeated hemogram test showed hemoglobin level of 12.4 g/dL, platelet of 276,000/\u00b5L, and leukocyte of 28,440/mm3. The peripheric blood film showed an eosinophilic ratio of 45%. The diagnosis of echinococcal infection was supported with positive indirect hemagglutination (IHA) and immunofluorescence antibody technique (IFAT) results of 1/640 and 1/1,000 respectively. The patient was given albendazole with an oral dose of 15 mg/kg/day twice a day. A cystectomy and capitonage operation was performed in the patient and a postoperative chest x-ray showed sufficient expansion of the lungs (). In the follow-up, abdominal ultrasonography and chest x-rays were normal without any other pathology. The patient was discharged with albendazole treatment and a further follow-up plan was made.",

The patient\u2019s hypertension and left flank pain had often occurred simultaneously throughout the last 2 years, with his blood pressure fluctuating within 130\u2013150/90\u2013100 mmHg without treatment. Seven months previously, he had developed severe headache and worsening left flank pain, and his blood pressure reached 200/105 mmHg. Amlodipine (5 mg twice daily) and spironolactone (40 mg twice daily) were administered to reduce his blood pressure, but treatment was ineffective. His blood pressure had recently fluctuated within 150\u2013180/95\u2013110 mmHg, and he was hospitalized for further investigation.\nOn admission, the patient was 182 cm tall and weighed 68 kg. Physical examination revealed slight throbbing pain over the left kidney area with a visual analog scale score of 4. No other obvious abnormalities were found.\nLaboratory data revealed a normal 24-hour urine protein level at 135 mg (reference range, 0\u2013150 mg/24 hours), microscopic hematuria (2+), and increased plasma renin activity (renin activity, aldosterone, angiotensin I, and angiotensin II) (). Color Doppler ultrasound examination (HD9 color Doppler ultrasound system; Philips, Amsterdam, Netherlands) revealed diffuse renal lesions, a broadened inner diameter of the LRV (approximately 12.7 mm), and an inner LRV diameter of 4.1 mm at the level of the SMA\u2013aorta angle. These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of NCS (). In addition, a computed tomography (CT) examination was performed using a GE Discovery CT750 (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) with the following scanning parameters: tube voltage, 120 kV; tube current, 160\u2013360 mA; scanning slice thickness, 5 mm; and reconstruction slice thickness, 1.25 mm. CT angiography (CTA) confirmed NCS (). The patient had no history of familial hypertension or special medications. His thyroid function, cortisol concentration, prolactin concentration, and adrenocorticotropic hormone concentration were normal. Thin-section enhanced CT of the adrenals showed no adrenal enlargement or occupying lesions. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging showed no abnormalities. Renal artery CTA showed no stenosis. None of the above secondary hypertension-related examinations showed significant abnormalities. These findings indicated the possibility that the hypertension might be associated with the observed abnormal LRV anatomy.\nSelective renal arteriography and venography (GE Innova 3100; GE Healthcare) were performed. The renal arteriography data were normal, but left renal venography indicated that the LRV was significantly narrowed before descending into the inferior vena cava, with clear regular compression; the anterior vein was significantly dilated (approximately 13 mm), and left-side varicoceles were seen (). The inferior vena cava pressure was 6 mmHg, and the LRV pressure was 15 mmHg. These findings confirmed a definitive diagnosis of NCS.\nConsidering that the patient had severe flank pain and that his hypertension might have been associated with this pain, an endovascular stent (14 \u00d7 60 mm; C. R. Bard, Murray Hill, NJ, USA) was placed into the stenosed part of the LRV. As a result, normal blood flow resumed and the collateral circulation was reduced (). Follow-up renal venography revealed a 2-mmHg pressure gradient between the LRV and inferior vena cava. Finally, the patient\u2019s blood pressure was reduced to 130\u2013140/80\u201395 mmHg 1 day later without drugs, and his 3-day postoperative visual analog scale score for the left flank pain was reduced to 1 to 2. Aspirin (0.1 once daily; Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany) and clopidogrel (75 mg once daily; Sanofi, Paris, France) were administered as a blood thinner and decongestant, respectively. The hypertension and flank pain did not recur during the following 11 months. Because the patient declined to undergo a biopsy, a pathological examination could not be performed.",

This will result to 33.0 g Albmumin/10.0 dL = 3.3 g Albmumin/dL. The concentration value of 33.0 g Albmumin/L converts to 3.3 g Albmumin/dL. \nThe concentration of Calcium is 8.4 mg/dL. \nPlugging these values into the formula, we get (0.8 * (4.0 g/dL - 3.3 g/dL)) + 8.4 mg/dL = 8.96 mg/dL.\nThe patient's corrected calcium concentration 8.96 mg/dL.",

        "Patient Note": "A 55-year-old woman was hospitalized in the nephrology unit of Huriez Hospital, Lille, in January 2016. She had no previous history of any major disease. She had been diagnosed a superficial spreading type melanoma of the right thigh in March 2015, with BRAF V600E mutation. In September 2015, a CT-scan detected a pulmonary metastasis. She was then treated with encorafenib (450 mg once a day per os), a new BRAF inhibitor, and binimetinib (45 mg twice a day per os), a MEK inhibitor.\nThe treatment started in November 2015, when serum creatinine concentration was 0.77 mg/dL. In January, the laboratory testing measured a serum creatinine concentration of 2.8 mg/dL, prompting transfer to our nephrology department. On arrival the patient's BP was 130/70 mm Hg, and her heart rate and temperature were 88 bpm and 37.6 \u00b0C, respectively. She weighed 74 kg. She only complained of having experienced joint pain in the previous few weeks, but examination revealed no arthritis. Otherwise, examination results were completely normal. She did not present any rash or skin lesions on the previous days. Her recent medical history did not record new events. Three days before she arrived, she took ibuprofen 200 mg twice a day. She did not take any other medication.\nThe patient's serum creatinine concentration was 2.8 mg/dL, with blood urea 114 mg/dL, sodium level 133 mmol/L, and potassium level 5 mmol/L. Albumin level was 33 g/L and calcium level 8.4 mg/dL. C-reactive protein level was 1.23 mg/dL. She had a leucocyte count of 11,000/mm3 including 8700 polynuclear neutrophils and 1500 lymphocytes without polynuclear eosinophils.\nUrine analysis showed a 1 g/day proteinuria, without leucocyturia or hematuria.\nSerum protein electrophoresis was normal. Plasma tests for antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody and antiglomerular basement membrane antibody were negative. The test for antinuclear antibodies was negative.\nA kidney biopsy was performed. Light microscopy revealed 6 glomeruli, including one that was globally sclerotic, with endocapillary proliferation in half of them. Four showed extracapillary proliferation with a granulomatous reaction. Several arterioles exhibited acute necrotizing arteritis with fibrinoid necrosis and a perivascular infiltrate that had a granulomatous appearance with palisading epithelioid macrophages. Major tubular necrosis was also present. Immunofluorescence was weakly positive for C1q and C3 staining, with focal and segmental endomembranous deposits. It was strongly positive for fibrinogen in the crescents. Immunostaining for kappa, lambda, IgG, IgA, and IgM was negative.\nElectron microscopy, in one glomerulus without crescent, showed podocytes with cytoplasmic swelling and vacuolization. There was also focal interdigitating foot-process effacement. We did not find any debris or deposit in the subendothelial space.\nEncorafenib and binimetinib were then stopped the 5th of January. The patient's serum creatinine decreased subsequently to 1.5 mg/dL at the beginning of February with a proteinuria stable at 1.2 g/24 hour. The patient did not receive steroids.\nStarting March 2016, she was subsequently treated with pembrolizumab, an immunotherapy targeting program cell death 1. From March to July 2016, serum creatinine level was around 1.1 mg/dL, and there was a resolution of proteinuria. However, there was neither improvement nor worsening of the cancer lesions with pembrolizumab. Therefore, in July 2016 dabrafenib and trametinib, alternative BRAF and MEK inhibitors were introduced, and pembrolizumab was stopped. In October 2016, serum creatinine was 1.0 mg/dL and urine analysis showed no proteinuria.",

        "Patient Note": "A 29-year-old multiparous female at 35 weeks and 6 days of gestational age arrived at our obstetrical triage unit in extremis with the chief complaint of abdominal pain. She was transported to the hospital by her male partner who provided the history. The abdominal pain was of abrupt onset approximately 1.5 hours prior to arrival and was mainly epigastric in origin. The partner observed a single episode of emesis en route and the gradual onset of confusion. The patient's prenatal course had otherwise been unremarkable. A physical examination revealed a lethargic and confused gravid female in apparent distress. The fundal height was 35 cm and the abdomen was diffusely tender. There was evidence of involuntary guarding and an absence of rebound tenderness. The systolic blood pressure was 60 mmHg as determined by palpation, pulse was 150 beats per minute, and body temperature was 38.2\u00b0C. She was able to localize pain and respond to simple commands. The obstetric history was significant for two prior uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal deliveries, one at term and one late preterm. An ultrasound study of the abdomen was performed at the bedside and showed a singleton fetus with a fetal heart rate of 70 beats per minute and free peritoneal fluid. The cervix was 3 cm dilated by digital examination, the membranes were intact, and there was no evidence of significant vaginal bleeding.\nTwo large bore intravenous lines were placed and aggressive fluid replacement was undertaken with normal saline. The systolic blood pressure improved modestly to 70/30. The fetal bradycardia persisted despite aggressive volume replacement, oxygen supplementation via nasal cannula, and position changes. An emergent exploratory laparotomy with cesarean delivery under general anesthesia was performed for the indications of suspected intra-abdominal hemorrhage and nonreassuring fetal heart tones. At the time of initial evaluation, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms was assumed to be uterine rupture. A Pfannenstiel incision was used to access the abdomen. Upon entering the peritoneal cavity, 1500 mL of hemoperitoneum was encountered. A viable female infant was delivered through a low transverse hysterotomy and transferred to the neonatologist for resuscitation. The hysterotomy site was closed and the abdomen and pelvis were packed with laparotomy sponges to control the hemorrhage and identify the source of bleeding. The packs were removed from the pelvis in a stepwise fashion. The uterus and accompanying pelvic structures were intact and were not the source of hemorrhage. Upon removing the packs from the upper abdomen, brisk bleeding was encountered following removal of the packs in the left upper quadrant. An intraoperative consultation was obtained from a general surgeon who created a midline vertical incision extending to the xiphoid. The lesser sac was opened revealing copious blood clot and a peripancreatic hematoma. Heavy bleeding from this area was encountered stemming from the spleen. A splenectomy and distal pancreatectomy were performed with cessation of bleeding. Intraoperatively, she received six units of packed red blood cells, four liters of crystallized fluids, four units of fresh frozen plasma, and one pack of pooled platelets after an estimated three-liter blood loss. She received two prophylactic doses of Cefazolin. Her abdomen was closed after a Jackson Pratt drain was placed, and she was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.\nPostoperatively, broad spectrum antibiotics were administered empirically for 6 days for leukocytosis and persistent fever to 38.2\u00b0C. A discrete source of infection was not identified. Appropriate vaccinations were administered to Haemophilus influenza, seasonal influenza, pneumococcus, and meningococcus. She was discharged home in stable condition on hospital day 8 with one week of oral antibiotics. The patient's long-term course was complicated by a pancreatic fistula that resolved with conservative management. Final pathology revealed a 165-gram spleen measuring 10.8 \u00d7 6.8 \u00d7 4.5 cm with a large aneurysm of the main splenic arterial branch.\nThe neonate was born with APGARS 0 and 2, an arterial blood gas pH of 6.507, pCO2 of 176, and a base excess of \u221229.4. The neonate was resuscitated, intubated, and given head cooling measures for suspected hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. An MRI of the head showed multiple brainstem infarcts. The neonate had multiple procedures performed to include tracheostomy and percutaneous gastrostomy. The infant was with severe neurologic impairment at one year of age.",

        "Patient Note": "An 85-year-old menopausal woman was referred to our hospital for diagnostic evaluation of worsening dyspnea over 6 weeks. The patient had a history of chronic atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) of uncertain etiology. She had a uterine fibroid diagnosed at 64 years of age. Pre-admission medication included amlodipine (10 mg/day), valsartan (40 mg/day), verapamil (120 mg/day), digoxin (0.125 mg/day), and rivaroxaban (10 mg/day).\nHer vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 146/97 mmHg, heart rate 90 beats/min and irregular, and respiratory rate 21 breaths/min. Physical examination revealed a third heart sound, diminished breath sounds from the right lower lungs, and notable bilateral leg edema, but no remarkable jugular vein distention (JVD) was observed. A hard mass was palpable in the lower abdomen. The electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation. Chest radiography revealed cardiomegaly and right-sided PE (Fig. a). Laboratory testing revealed elevated levels of serum creatinine (1.36 mg/dL, reference, 0.65\u20131.07 mg/dL) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) (183 pg/mL, reference: < 18.4 pg/mL). Hepatic and thyroid function, C-reactive protein levels, and urinalysis were within normal ranges.\nEchocardiography demonstrated normal left ventricular (LV) cavity size and systolic function, with an ejection fraction of 54% and left atrial dilation (35 mL/m2) (Additional files and ). Doppler and tissue Doppler profiles for the assessment of LV diastolic function revealed a decreased septal e\u2032 of 5.8 cm/sec and an elevated E/e\u2032 of 17, indicating elevated LV filling pressure. In addition, continuous wave Doppler revealed a peak tricuspid regurgitation velocity of 2.6 m/s, consistent with a pressure gradient of 27 mmHg and an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of approximately 35 mmHg. Echocardiographic evaluation of the right heart revealed almost normal systolic function; tissue Doppler of the free lateral wall (S\u2032) = 9 cm/s (reference: \u2265 10 cm/s), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion = 18 mm (reference: 16 \u2265 mm), and fractional area change = 53% (reference: \u2265 35%), respectively.\nThus, a tentative diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) was made. The patient was administered oxygen at 3 L/min and treated with intravenous loop diuretics (furosemide 40 mg daily). On day 6, although diuretic treatment improved leg edema, PE remained unchanged (Fig. b).\nA subsequent diagnostic workup of unexplained PE was performed. The patient underwent thoracentesis with drainage of 1240 mL of serosanguineous PE. PE analysis revealed lymphocyte-predominant exudates fulfilling Light\u2019s criteria (Table ). Additionally, the serum-to-effusion albumin gradient was 0.3 g/dL (reference: \u2264 1.2 g/dL), further confirming the true exudative effusion. The adenosine deaminase activity in PE was 9.3 U/L. PE cytology, as well as the bacterial and mycobacterial cultures, were unremarkable.\nChest computed tomography revealed an absence of lung tumors or inflammatory infiltration after the removal of PE. Abdominal/pelvic computed tomography scan revealed bilateral inhomogeneous ovarian masses (Fig. ). Magnetic resonance imaging further characterized the right substantial mass and detected a trivial ascites (Fig. ). Axial and sagittal T2-weighted images demonstrated the peripheral hypointense mass, which contained hyperintense and multilocular areas in the central portion, mimicking a malignant ovarian tumor with a central necrosis or a degenerated subserosal fibroid. Gadolinium-enhanced axial imaging showed inhomogeneous enhancement correspondently on the peripheral solid portion, suggesting malignancy. In addition, screening tests for tumor markers revealed elevated CA-125 levels (382 U/mL, reference: < 35 U/mL). Repeated serial thoracentesis was ineffective, and PE reaccumulated within a week (Fig. c-f). Thus, we highly suspected of ovarian cancer with pleural dissemination. Nevertheless, a repeated cytological examination of PE revealed no evidence of malignancy, which led us to consider the possibility of MS.\nOn day 26, the patient underwent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (Fig. ). The resected masses exhibited yellow-to-tan fleshy cut surfaces, with hemorrhage and extensive hyaline degeneration. Histopathological examination revealed a mitotically active cellular fibroma (MACF) of the ovary. Spontaneous resolution of the right-sided PE was noted post-operatively after 7 days of follow-up, confirming a definitive diagnosis of MS. A follow-up echocardiography revealed no significant changes. The post-operative course was uneventful, and the patient made a full recovery and was discharged with no changes to her pre-admission medication regimen on day 33. She remained clinically stable upon subsequent follow-up.",

We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of bilirubin from \u00b5mol to mg. The mass of bilirubin is 28.1 \u00b5mol. To convert 28.1 \u00b5mol of bilirubin to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 28.1 \u00b5mol bilirubin * 1e-06 mol/\u00b5mol = 2.81e-05 mol bilirubin. To convert from mol bilirubin to grams, multiply by the molar mass 548.66 g/mol, which will give 2.81e-05 mol bilirubin * 548.66 g/mol = 0.015 g bilirubin. To convert 0.015 g of bilirubin to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.015 g bilirubin * 1000.0 mg/g = 15.0 mg bilirubin.

During one of the syncopal event, he had a fall, which was associated with scalp injury and epistaxis. No vomiting or seizure was reported during the syncopal event. On admission to hospital, he was normotensive, with a pulse rate of 80/min, with a blood pressure of 110/70 mm of hg. On physical examination, he was found to have palpable right supraclavicular lymph node, which was firm to hard, mobile, and non-tender, and JVP was not raised. Breath sounds were decreased in the lower right hemithorax. The hemoglobin level was 13.4 g/dL, leukocyte count of 11000/cmm. The chest x-ray showed right hilar prominence. A high-resolution contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest was performed, which showed a concentric thickening of tracheobronchial tree, which was more pronounced in the lower lobe of the right lung with distal consolidation and ground-glass opacities. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions and a moderate pericardial effusion were also seen. Fine needle aspiration of right supraclavicular lymph node showed Metastatic Non-Small Cell Carcinoma.\nTransthoracic echocardiography revealed moderate pericardial effusion with 2 cm of fluid behind the posterior wall of the left ventricle [], no diastolic collapse of the ventricles. The IVC did not collapse with respiration. The heart valves and left ventricular systolic function were normal, with an ejection fraction of 60%.\nAn episode of cough syncope was witnessed in the ICU, during which the systolic blood pressure showed a 60 mm drop, along with tachycardia. After recovery from this episode, an echocardiogram was repeated, which showed evidence of tamponade in the form of early diastolic collapse of right ventricle, late diastolic right atrial inversion with abnormal movement of the septum when the patient coughed, which disappeared when he stopped coughing.\nPericardiocentesis was performed, 500 ml of hemorrhagic fluid was drained, and a pigtail catheter was placed for further drainage of fluid. After drainage of the pericardial fluid, the patient did not experience any further episodes of cough syncope.\nThe pericardial fluid too showed numerous mesothelial cells and clusters of atypical cells, which were identified as metastatic Non-Small Cell Carcinoma.",

        "Patient Note": "A 35-year-old Asian man was referred to Good Gang-An Hospital mainly because of intermittent pruritus and fatigue that lasted for two months. The patient was suspected to be in the window period of hepatitis B based on the detection of IgM anti-HBc antibody (+) with increased aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels in his blood about a month ago. He had been drinking approximately a bottle of beer once a month but does not smoke. His family history was not significant. At the time of his visit to this hospital, his blood pressure was 120/80 mm Hg; pulse rate, 76/min; respiration rate, 20/min; and temperature, 36.5\u2103. Moreover, the patient was conscious and had no specific symptom but fatigue. His breath sound was normal during chest auscultation; neither whole body jaundice nor icteric sclera was observed. No tactile mass was noted in the abdominal region; neither abdominal pain nor abdominal fluid was found. The peripheral blood test showed that his hemoglobin was 14.6 g/dL (reference range, 11\u201316 g/dL); white blood cell count, 4,880 cells/mcL (reference range, 3,600\u20139,500 cells/mcL); and platelet, 181,000 cells/mcL (reference range, 150,000\u2013450,000 cells/mcL). The biochemical test revealed the following: total protein, 9.2 g/dL (reference range, 6.4\u20138.3 g/dL); albumin, 4.4 g/dL (reference range, 3.8\u20135.3 g/dL); AST, 107 IU/L (reference range, 8\u201338 IU/L); ALT, 104 IU/L (reference range, 5\u201343 IU/L); alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 1,431 IU/L (reference range, 35\u2013105 IU/L); gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), 813 IU/L (reference range, 15\u201375 IU/L); total bilirubin, 0.4 mg/dL (reference range, 0.2\u20131.2 mg/dL); direct bilirubin, 0.1 mg/dL (reference range, 0\u20130.4 mg/dL); blood urea nitrogen, 13.9 mg/dL (reference range, 7\u201320 mg/dL); creatinine, 1.0 mg/dL (reference range, 0.7\u20131.3 mg/dL); and lactate dehydrogenase, 518 IU/L (reference range, 263\u2013450 IU/L). The immunoserological test found hepatitis B surface (HBs) antigen/antibody (\u2212/\u2212), hepatitis B e (HBe) antigen/antibody (\u2212/\u2212), hepatitis C virus antibody (\u2212), anti-hepatitis A virus (HAV) IgM (\u2212), anti-HAV IgG (\u2212), IgM anti-HBc antibody (+), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA quantification (\u2212) (). He was diagnosed with PBC because of his increased ALP and GGT levels in the blood test and increased IgM/IgG (518/1,740 mg/dL) in the additional blood test; he was also both AMA and antinuclear antibody (ANA) positive. Nothing significant was noted on his chest and simple abdominal X-ray. Moreover, no abnormal findings were observed; however, an approximately 2 cm hepatic cyst was found through abdominal computed tomography (). The development of the disease and screen associated autoimmune hepatitis was assessed. Liver biopsy found intrahepatic bile duct injury and epithelial cell infiltration in the lymphocytes, both of which characterize PBC, but did not indicate severe fibrosis or any condition that suggested autoimmune hepatitis (). Based on AMA and ANA (+) and the blood test results, which suggested a cholestatic disease, he was diagnosed with PBC. The patient was administered with a high dose of ursodesoxycholic acid (UDCA, 900 mg/d) for three months. After the treatment, both fatigue and pruritus decreased, and the AST, ALT, ALP, and GGT were 34, 18, 350, and 107 IU/L, respectively. Six months later, the patient exhibited lower ALP and GGT levels and negative IgM anti-HBc antibody in the follow-up test ().",

She had no significant medical history, allergy, or previous neurological disease. She underwent surgery for the same condition 1 year earlier at another hospital. Spinal anesthesia was performed and the operation was uneventful. After transferring to the general ward, the patient's right leg began moving involuntarily. The movement was rhythmic and was limited to the right leg. The transient movement disappeared completely after 30 min, and no complication resulted. A specific diagnosis for the movement was not determined. The patient experienced no further problem.\nOn a preoperative visit to our hospital, she expressed no fear regarding spinal anesthesia and agreed to undergo spinal anesthesia again.\nPremedication consisted of 2.5 mg of midazolam, administered intramuscularly 30 min before surgery. In the operating room, standard monitoring (non-invasive blood pressure, peripheral oxygen saturation, and electrocardiogram) was used. The patient was placed in the right lateral decubitus position, and lumbar puncture was performed without difficulty at L3-4. After free-flowing cerebrospinal fluid was obtained, 9 mg of heavy bupivacaine 0.5% (Marcaine Spinal 0.5% Heavy\u00ae, AstraZeneca, Sweden) and 0.2 mg of epinephrine were administered via a 25 G spinal needle. The procedure was performed without complication. Sensory input to T10 was blocked, and the surgery was completed uneventfully in approximately 50 min.\nAfter surgery, the patient was transferred to a recovery room. Approximately 100 min after administration of anesthesia, she began to experience bilateral, involuntary myoclonic movement of both legs and arms. Sensory function in her arms was intact, and the rhythm of the movement varied widely in rate. She was conscious, oriented, and calm. At that point, 2 mg of midazolam was administered intravenously. Approximately 10 min later, she was treated with 0.5 mg of oral clonazepam and 2 mg of IV midazolam. The myoclonic movement diminished slightly, but persisted. A neurology consult was obtained. There was no evidence of weakness or impairment of cerebellar or cranial nerve dysfunction. Thus, these movements were clinically defined as spinal myoclonus. After approximately 1 h, 0.5 mg of clonazepam was administered again. The myoclonic movement disappeared completely at 4 h after its onset. Postoperative laboratory findings, including serum electrolytes and glucose, were within normal limits. When she was examined again the following day, no abnormal neurologic finding was evident. One month later, she visited the hospital again; no recurrence of spinal myoclonus had occurred.",

Abdominal computed tomography showed 4.3 \u00d7 4.2 cm and 3.1 \u00d7 3.5 cm inhomogeneous enhancing masses at liver segment 4A with moderately dilated intrahepatic ducts (Fig. ). Based on the symptoms of biliary obstruction, typical imaging findings, and elevated serum CA 19-9, the most likely diagnosis was cholangiocarcinoma (Bismuth\u2013Corlette type IIIb). He was initially given intravenous fluids to combat his oliguric renal failure, but there was no improvement in serum creatinine and urine output. Over the next 5 days, hemodialysis was initiated due to diuretic-resistant oliguric acute renal failure. Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) was also performed to relieve his obstructive jaundice. However, he still experienced clinical deterioration. After approximately 2 weeks of hemodialysis, his total serum bilirubin continued to be in the 30 mg/dL range and he remained oliguric. On the 27th day of admission, the patient suffered from massive biliary hemorrhage requiring a blood transfusion. An emergency esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed and revealed active hemorrhage from the ampulla of Vater, a finding suggestive of tumor bleeding. After thorough discussion and consultation between the patient's family and the palliative care team, the healthcare providers proceed to initiate palliative treatment.",

He was a bus driver. He had no particular past medical or social history other than the occasional ingestion of wild mushrooms during recreational hiking. He was healthy before this admission. He did not have a history of trauma, infection, other known underlying cause, or medication use that could explain the occurrence of rhabdomyolysis. He shared the meal with his wife and son who did not eat any more mushrooms due to nausea after ingesting a single piece of mushroom. However, he ate the mushrooms without immediate symptom. Six hours later, he began to complain of vomiting, diarrhea, and myalgia. He visited a local hospital where his general condition worsened and systolic BP fell to 60 mmHg requiring dopamine treatment and endotracheal intubation. Twenty-eight hours after ingestion of the mushrooms, he was transferred to the intensive care unit of our hospital. At the time of admission, he was alert, but acute ill-looking. He complained of generalized myalgia, chest discomfort, palpitations, and dyspnea. Blood pressure was 80/56 mmHg, heart rate 121/min, respiratory rate 25/min, and body temperature 36.3oC. Oliguria was noted with no response to intravenous fluid and furosemide. Systolic murmurs were present on auscultation.

Urine analysis showed pH 5.0, specific gravity 1.020, protein 2+, ketone 2+, blood 4+, RBC 5-9/high-power field, and WBC 0-1/high-power field. Blood and urine cultures were all negative for microorganism. Arterial blood gas analysis was pH 7.04, PaCO2 69 mmHg, PaO2 172 mmHg, and HCO3\n- 18.7 mmol/L. Chest radiographs revealed mild cardiomegaly without lung lesion. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia with QT prolongation. The enlarged left ventricle (LV), severe LV systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction 30%), and akinesia of LV mid to apex wall suggesting stress induced cardiomyopathy were noted on echocardiography. He received ventilator support, hemodynamic monitoring, continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration, and conservative care including intravenous fluid and electrolyte repletion. Seventy hours after ingestion of the mushrooms, BUN 41.9 mg/dL, serum creatinine 3.46 mg/dL, AST 3,271 U/L, ALT 1,254 U/L, total bilirubin 1.55 mg/dL, CK 121,397 U/L, CK-MB >500 ng/mL, LDH 6,102 U/L, troponin I 11.77 ng/mL, amylase 2,779 U/L, lipase 601 U/L, PT 42.1 seconds.

We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 137.0 mEq. To convert from 137.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol.

        "Patient Note": "In the 1998 report on the treatment of B, he was 20 years old. B had been a child with a classical gender dysphoric development and fulfilled the current criteria for GnRH analog treatment eligibility. He was interviewed shortly after his legal gender change. This meant that he had had puberty suppression, cross-sex hormone treatment, a mastectomy, ovariectomy, and uterus extirpation. From his assessment during the diagnostic phase, he appeared to be an intelligent person (IQ = 128) with excellent problem-solving capabilities with respect to emotional matters. Vulnerable aspects of his psychological functioning were his insecurity about himself and moderately depressed feelings. In all other areas, his scores on a broad range of measures were in the average range, as compared to Dutch normative samples. Shame concerning his transsexualism made him highly selective in his friendships and guarded in his contacts with new people. At the assessment, 1 year after his ovariectomy but prior to his metaidoioplasty, he no longer reported feelings of gender dysphoria. He had adjusted easily to the male role and expressed no doubts on the adequacy of his masculine behavior. After the development of his secondary male sex characteristics, nobody had ever approached him as a woman. He never felt any regrets about his decision and had never contemplated living as a girl again. Knowing what gender reassignment implied, he would do it all over again. B was happy with his life and did not feel lonely. He showed a significant pre-post treatment decrease in his feelings of inadequacy. At the time, he was attending medical school.\nB attended the pediatric endocrinology clinic for the first time when he was age 13.7 years. His medical history was uneventful. Puberty had started 1\u20132 years previously, but menarche had not occurred. On physical examination, a healthy girl was seen with a height of 157.3 cm and a Tanner pubertal stage of B3, P3. Bone age according to Tanner and Whitehouse was 13.5 years. Target height, as a female, was estimated at 171 cm, based on the parental height. Puberty suppression was induced by the GnRH analog Triptorelin, in a dose of 3.75 mg every 4 weeks intramuscularly. On this dosage, B steadily kept on growing.\nAt age 18.6 years, his height was 165.8 cm. Induction of male puberty and accompanying secondary male sex characteristics was initiated by administration of 100 mg testosterone-ester mixture intramuscularly every 2 weeks. This was, after 6 months, increased to 250 mg testosterone-ester mixture, every 2\u20133 weeks intramuscularly. At the start of the androgen treatment, the Triptorelin treatment was discontinued.\nWhen B was 20 years old, he had a subcutaneous mastectomy by way of an infra-areolar approach, a few months later followed by a hysterectomy and gonadectomy. Two years later, metaidoioplasty and testes implantation were performed.\nFifteen years after the first interview and testing session, at age 35, B was seen again at the clinic. He lived on his own and he worked as a family doctor in private practice with two colleagues. All family members knew about his transitioning as did some of his friends. He was very satisfied about his circle of friends and had never been treated negatively because of his transsexualism.\nB was still satisfied about his (minor) breast surgery, his ovariectomy, and his hysterectomy, but no longer about the metaidoioplasty he underwent one year after the first follow-up session. He did not like its size and shape and he could hardly urinate in a standing position. He was able to have orgasms, but he could not have sexual intercourse. Because of his desire to have more convincingly male appearing external genitals and his wish to be able urinate in a standing position, he considered having a phalloplasty. Despite his good looks and very masculine appearance, he had not had many steady girlfriends, which may have resulted from the guardedness he already had as an adolescent. At age 29, he had a serious relationship with a woman, which lasted for 5 years. However, he chose not to live together when the opportunity to do so arose. After his choice to continue living apart, his girlfriend ended the relationship, a few months before his interview at the clinic. This made him very much regret his lack of commitment. B considered it likely that his need to distance himself from her had been related to his shame about his genital appearance and his feelings of inadequacy in sexual matters. Additional factors, such as serious illness of his father and a suicide among his sisters\u2019 in-laws, made him rather sad at the time of the interview. Although his psychoneuroticism score on the Symptom Checklist-90 (Arrindell & Ettema, ) was in the normal range, his depression subscore was high, indicating depressed feelings. However, on the Beck Depression Inventory, he scored in the \u201cminimal range\u201d (van der Does, ), indicating that he did not fulfill criteria for clinical depression. On the Adult Self-Report, assessing adaptive functioning and problems in adults aged 18-59 years (Achenbach & Rescorla, ), all his scores were in the normal range.\nIt seems, therefore, that B functioned well in most aspects of life, but that he was still struggling with the question, how to handle the dissatisfaction and shame about his genital appearance.\nAt age 35, on physical examination, we saw a healthy and well virilized person. Blood pressure was 120/85 mmHg, final height was 169.5 cm and weight was 73 kg, which resulted in a body mass index (BMI) of 25.4 kg/m2. Sitting height was 88 cm. Skull circumference was 55.5 cm. For a comparison of his anthropometrical measurements to the normal reference values of Dutch males and females, see Table .\nA fasting venous blood sample was drawn. General health markers, like hematological parameters (Hb, ht, erythrocytes), renal function, and liver enzymes, were all within the normal reference value ranges. His lipid profile showed a total cholesterol level of 228.3 mg/dl (<251.5 mg/dl), LDL-cholesterol 154.8 mg/dl (<193.5 mg/dl), HDL-cholesterol 55.0 mg/dl (>34.8 mg/dl), and triglycerides 97.4 mg/dl (<177 mg/dl). His glucose value was 97.3 mg/dl (<144.1 mmol/l) with an insulin level of 21 pmol/l (12\u201396 pmol/l for a fasting sample). His HbA1c was 5.4% (4.3\u20136.1%). These values were in the normal range.\nWith respect to the gonadal axis, a normal-low serum testosterone level of 236.6 ng/dl (231\u2013866 ng/dl) was found. This relatively low level was probably due to the fact that the blood sample was taken just before the next testosterone-ester mixture injection. Gonadotropins were elevated as a consequence of the gonadectomy. LH and FSH were 16 U/l and 50 U/l, respectively. Additionally determined endocrine parameters, such as thyroid and adrenal function, were all within normal reference ranges.\nWith respect to bone mineral density (BMD), a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan was performed to determine B\u2019s BMD in the lumbar spine, the non-dominant hip, and (further) total body. The observed values were related to the bone peak mass for white females and for white males, resulting in T-scores. For all values, the z-score was determined as well (see Table ).",

She was also complaining of a cough and back pain at the time of evaluation. She admitted to having a fall 3 weeks prior. Further review of systems was negative. Vital signs were blood pressure of 155/80 mmHg, pulse of 74 beats per minute, respirations of 18, and temperature of 36.7\u00b0C. Examination revealed a soft abdomen with right lower quadrant tenderness to palpation without evidence of an inguinal mass or erythema. Lab analysis was essentially normal. There was no leukocytosis. A CT scan of her abdomen was obtained due to her back pain and RLQ pain. The CT was interpreted by radiology as a right femoral hernia containing an inflamed appendix. Refer to Figures and for CT images. The patient was treated operatively with laparoscopic appendectomy and by McVay hernia repair. No mesh was used during the repair of the hernia. The postoperative diagnoses were more complicated than what was visualized by radiology on the CT and included a Pantaloon hernia, a femoral hernia, and an Amyand's hernia containing an early, nonperforated appendicitis. The patient had no intraoperative or postoperative complications with the exception of pain, classified as Clavien-Dindo grade 1. On postoperative day 2, she was discharged to the skilled nursing facility where she resided. She is also on PPI treatment for a gastric ulcer. Denies any history of stroke, immunodeficiency, or neurological deficits. Her A1C has never been elevated in the past. Her creatinine is 0.8 with no signs of kidney dysfunction.",

She had a history of ulcerative colitis that was treated with medication (oral prednisolone 35mg/day, mesalazine 3,000 mg/day). Two weeks prior to admission, she had discontinued the steroid treatment and wanted to be treated with alternative medicine that included sodium chloride, multivitamin, and selenium with discontinuation of her regular diet.\nClinically, she was severely dehydrated due to frequent watery diarrhea. She was hypotensive and her blood pressure was 80/50mmHg. On initial examination, she was stuporous and slightly confused, and she responded only to painful stimuli and had weakness in both arms and legs. A hypoactive deep tendon reflex was present, but there were no other focal neurological deficits or neck stiffness.\nInitial blood laboratory test results showed a sodium level of 197mEq/L (range, 135-146mEq/L), potassium level of 2.9mEq/L (range, 3.5-5.3mEq/L), chloride level of 159mEq/L (range, 99-108mEq/L), blood urea nitrogen level of 96mg/dL (range, 8-19mg/dL), creatinine level of 1.56mg/dL (range, 0.67-1.17mg/dL), serum osmolality of 415mOsm/kgH2O(range, 280-300mOsm/kgH2O), ACTH level of 3.99 pg/mL (range, 7.2-63.3 pg/mL), and serum cortisol level of 30.84 ug/dL (range, 4.3-22.4 ug/dL). Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.030, osmolality of 885mOsm/kgH2O, urine sodium level of 12.0mEq/L, and urine creatinine level of 128.1mg/dL.\nThe patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit where intravenous fluids were rapidly administered and serial monitoring of electrolytes and osmolality was started. There was no evidence of adrenal insufficiency, but we intravenously administered dexamethasone 5mg and hydrocortisone 100mg/day considering her history of steroid use for protection from adrenal insufficiency. Immediate treatment with 0.45% saline and 5% dextrose water was started along with modification of the rate and concentration so that the fall in serum sodium level did not exceed 0.5mEq/L/hour. Despite our effort to avoid very rapid correction of hypernatremia, the correction rate exceeded 1mEq/L/hour (, ).\nSix days after admission, the serum sodium level was 149mEq/L and she had partially recovered her mental status, especially her early depression of consciousness level; however, weakness in all extremities persisted. Diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed on hospital day 6 revealed multifocal, symmetric, diffusion restriction within the lateral pons, thalami, and splenium of the corpus callosum(). However, there were no abnormal signal intensity changes on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. Considering the clinical and radiologic findings, despite the unusual pattern in the pons, our diagnosis was osmotic demyelination syndrome involving both the lateral pontine and extrapontine sites associated with rapid correction of hypernatremia. The patient was closely observed and was treated with corticosteroid therapy and conservative management including nutritional support.\nFollow-up MRI performed on hospital day 30 revealed high signal intensity changes in the lateral pons and bilateral thalami on FLAIR images, which were pseudonormalized on DW images (). The previously noted corpus callosum lesion had resolved on FLAIR and DW images. The patient's mental status and motor weakness were improved, and she was discharged to a rehabilitation hospital at hospital day 49. She remained free of neurologic symptoms during the 6-month follow-up period, and the serum sodium concentration had stabilized.",

        "Patient Note": "Case 1 is a 47-year-old male who recalls gradually worsening illness starting around the age of 25 that he partially attributes to poor food choices and opioid use. By the age of 36, he recalls knowing that he had \u201cundeniable, serious illness,\u201d and by the age of 38, he weighed over 400 pounds and suffered from severe sleep apnea, asthma and trouble breathing, eczema, allergies, hypertension (SBP/DBP = 255/155 on 2 medications), high total cholesterol (300 mg/dL), high triglycerides (279 mg/dL), and chronic shoulder and joint pain. He had difficulty moving and completing basic activities of daily living, such as putting on his shoes. He was on a number of medications that cost him approximately USD 7680 out of pocket, annually, while his insurance company paid a total of USD 19,646 for medications in 2009 alone. In addition to seeing a physician at least once every 1\u20132 weeks for his various conditions, he attended monthly appointments to aspirate fluid from his knees, had multiple visits to the ER, underwent shoulder surgery, and had one ankle reconstruction surgery with a second one imminent. Around 2012, at the age of 38, he decided to pursue gastric bypass surgery; however, his physician did not clear him to undergo the procedure, due to his poor underlying health. This event, combined with the recent deaths of two close family members, is what ultimately prompted him to begin considering lifestyle changes to improve his health. Initially, his approach to change was \u201cgoing one step further than the day before.\u201d First, he forced himself to simply get up from his chair once, and then twice per day, and then he progressed to being able to go on walks and walk up the stairs. He began researching additional lifestyle changes and watched documentaries, such as Forks Over Knives, which he describes as providing an entirely new perspective on food. He adopted dietary changes that began with a green juice fast followed by calorie restrictions, reducing red meat, and changing from full to lower fat dairy. On 1 January 2013, he adopted a strict, whole-food, plant-based (WFPB) dietary pattern. Thus, what started initially as a set of small lifestyle changes ultimately fostered a completely new lifestyle approach\u2014one where fitness and plant-based eating were the focus. Approximately 6 months into the lifestyle change, Case 1 had lost 150\u2013200 pounds, and although he does not recall his exact numbers, his cholesterol was cut in half, and triglyceride levels were in the normal range. By 2015, his cholesterol was 112 mg/dL and triglycerides were 74 mg/dL. In just 3\u20134 years, he went from barely standing up from a chair to running his first marathon in May 2016; by 2017, he was completing Ironman competitions and later ran an ultra-marathon. His current laboratory values as of 20 May 2021 include a total cholesterol of 103 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 36 mg/dL, triglycerides 61 mg/dL, non-HDL cholesterol 67 mg/dL, and blood pressure 122/78. Post lifestyle change, he also notes significant improvement in his level of happiness and quality of life, specifically with respect to being able to enjoy time with his family, traveling, and gaining a new outlook on life.\nAside from the possibility of gastric bypass surgery (USD 18,000\u201335,000) [], Case 1 was a candidate for a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machine for obstructive sleep apnea (USD 1000\u20133000) [] and a Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator (TENS) machine for pain management (approximately USD 100\u2013500) [] prior to his lifestyle change, highlighting an approximate average savings of USD 28,800 in discreet medical costs potentially avoided. Post lifestyle change, he reports spending only USD 61 per year on medications (B12 injections), as opposed to his previous approximated average spending of USD 7600+ in annual medication costs. Pharmaceutical costs covered by his insurance company decreased from USD 19,000+ in 2009 to USD 122.24 in 2015 and 2016 combined. In addition, his grocery costs are approximately half of what they were prior to his lifestyle change.",

        "Patient Note": "The patient was a 72-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history of long-standing gastroesophageal reflux disease, tobacco dependence (over 50 packs/year), cerebrovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted to the medical intensive-care unit (MICU) for the evaluation of pneumomediastinum. Two weeks before admission, the patient had been seen in a community emergency department with a three-day history of fevers, dyspnea, and cough. He had been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and treated with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. The patient had subsequently returned to the emergency department two days later with worsening symptoms and hematemesis. At the MICU, a CT of the chest showed a right lower lobe consolidation and pneumomediastinum (Figure ). The pneumomediastinum tracked from the right paratracheal region along the right lateral aspect of the esophagus to the gastroesophageal junction. There was also a marked thickening of the distal esophagus (Figure ). Vital signs on arrival included a temperature of 38.3\u00b0 Celsius, a heart rate of 92 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 144/65, and an oxygen saturation of 97% on 15 liters of supplemental oxygen via non-rebreather. Physical examination revealed bilateral diffuse rhonchi. Laboratory studies on arrival were remarkable for a white blood cell (WBC) count of 19.75 x109/L, hemoglobin of 13.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 354 x109/L. Renal function was diminished with a serum creatinine of 1.69 mg/dL (baseline: 1.4 mg/dL) and blood urea nitrogen of 39 mg/dL. Abnormal serum chemistry lab results included albumin level of 2.9 g/dL, and liver enzymes were elevated with an alkaline phosphatase of 172 units/L, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase at 112 units/L and 66 units/L, respectively. Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein (CRP) were both elevated at 3.53 ng/mL and 43.95 mg/dL, respectively. Arterial blood gas on a 60% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) demonstrated a pH of 7.472, pCO2 of 32.1 mmHg, pO2 of 72.7 mmHg, and HCO3 of 23.2 mmol/L. The alveolar-arterial gradient was elevated at 315 mmHg.\nThe differential diagnosis of pneumomediastinum in the setting of esophageal wall thickening includes Boerhaave\u2019s syndrome (retching- associated esophageal rupture), malignancy-associated esophageal rupture, infectious infiltration of the esophagus, and esophagitis-related esophageal rupture. Initial management of our patient included intubation for increased respiratory rate and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Once intubated, the patient was placed on a strict nil-per-os (NPO) status. Intravenous (IV) pantoprazole was scheduled every 12 hours, and empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy was started for suspected pneumonia after bedside bronchoscopy. Bronchoscopy showed no obvious airway deformities or perforations on inspection but did reveal thick copious secretions that were therapeutically aspirated and sent for culture.\nA Gastrografin (Schering AG, Berlin, Germany) study was ordered but could not be performed as nasogastric or orogastric tubes could not be placed due to concern for esophageal perforation. Thoracic surgery was consulted and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed in the operating room. EGD demonstrated no obvious tear or perforation but did show swollen and black mucosa primarily involving the distal esophagus (Figure ). The gastric mucosa was unaffected. Tissue cultures from the EGD grew Klebsiella pneumoniae, which was also grown from the bronchial wash and bronchoalveolar lavage (Table ). EGD findings were consistent with acute esophageal necrosis (AEN), and the patient continued to remain NPO. Total parenteral nutrition was considered but deferred as a jejunostomy tube had been placed by thoracic surgery to provide the patient with enteral nutrition to promote healing. Though surgical esophagectomy was considered by the thoracic surgeons, the patient was ultimately deemed to be a poor surgical candidate given his multiple comorbidities.\nThe patient\u2019s hospitalization was complicated by critical limb ischemia of the right lower extremity, which prompted the use of a heparin drip. Unfortunately, the patient developed a gastrointestinal bleed while on therapeutic anticoagulation. After a goals-of-care discussion with the patient\u2019s family, the decision was made to extubate the patient to focus on comfort measures. The patient passed away peacefully soon thereafter.",

The note does not specify whether the patient is a smoker and so we assume this to be false, making the smoking variable equal to 0.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 120.0 mm Hg.\nThe patient has been specified to take medication for treating their blood pressure, making the bp_medicine variable equal to 1.\nThe concentration of total cholestrol is 199.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 199.0 mg. To convert 199.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 199.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.199 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.199 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.000515 mol total cholestrol. To convert 0.000515 mol of total cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000515 mol total cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.515 mmol total cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.515 mmol total cholestrol/0.1 L = 5.15 mmol total cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 199.0 mg total cholestrol/dL converts to 5.15 mmol total cholestrol/L. \nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 76.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 76.0 mg. To convert 76.0 mg of hdl cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 76.0 mg hdl cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.076 g hdl cholestrol. To convert from grams of hdl cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.076 g/(386.65 g hdl cholestrol/mol) = 0.000197 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.000197 mol of hdl cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000197 mol hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.197 mmol hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.197 mmol hdl cholestrol/0.1 L = 1.97 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 76.0 mg hdl cholestrol/dL converts to 1.97 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. \nPlugging in these values will give us the risk score: 31.764001 * ln(60) + 22.465206 * ln(5.15) - 1.187731 * ln(1.97) + 2.552905 * ln(120.0) + 0.420251 * 1 + 13.07543 * 0 + -5.060998 * ln(60) * ln(5.15) + -2.996945 * ln(60) * 0 - 146.5933061 = -1.8.\nPlugging this into the MI risk formula gives us 1 - 0.98767^exp(-1.8) = 0.0 %.\nThe patient's percentage of getting MI or dying is 0.0 %.",

        "Patient Note": "We describe the case of a 60-year-old Caucasian woman with a positive familial history for dyslipidemia and nephropathy.\nThe patient was first hospitalized in February 2001 with: hypertension (160/100 mmHg), high lipidic values (cholesterol 372 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol 267 mg/dl, triglycerides 239 mg/dl), creatininemia within the standard limits (0.9 mg/dl), a corresponding GFR of 63 ml/min calculated according to Cockroft and Gault, albuminemia of 3.15 gr/dl, total proteins of 5.7 g/dl, and a micro-hematuria, proteinuria (200 mg/dl) and proteinuria and/or albuminuria ratio of 2 g/g. The main immunological studies, ASO, rheumatoid factor, C3-C4, VDRL, serum immuno-fixation and serum immunoglobulin were normal. The serum markers for HBV, HCV and HIV were negative. The leucocyte formula was normal.\nA physical examination ruled out the presence of xanthelasma and corneal arc in the absence of edemas. An ultrasound revealed kidneys which were regular in dimension and structure.\nA renal biopsy showed the presence of lipid deposits in the glomerular lumens under the optical microscope after staining with Red-O oil. The interstitium showed a diffuse fibrous edema and tubular atrophy in the areas of fibrosis with a moderate infiltration of inflammatory cells. An arteriole showed hyaline deposits. An immunofluorescence revealed the presence of deposits of IgM and C3 in the sub endothelial seat. An electronic ultrastructural analysis confirmed the presence of thrombi in the lumen of the glomerular capillary loops. The histopathological diagnosis suspected LPG, but ApoE typing identified the polymorphism (E2/2) with a diagnosis of familial type III dyslipoproteinemia.\nThe patient started treatment with atorvastatin 40 mg/day. We did not use fibrates in association with statin to avoid possible side effects. After one year of therapy we observed a good control of lipid values (cholesterol 250 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol 114 mg/dl) and a reduction of the proteinuria (120 mg/dl). Hypertension was controlled (145/90 mmHg) by means of ACE-inhibitors (irbesartan 300 mg/day, ramipril 5 mg/day), beta-blockers (carvedilole 25 mg/day) and Ca antagonists (nifedipine 60 mg/day).\nFour years later in April 2005, the patient was again hospitalized for clinically overt nephrotic syndrome with proteinuria (5 g/24 h) and renal failure (creatinine 2.2 mg/dl). Arterial hypertension (180/100 mmHg) was hardly responsive to treatment. The patient had a low response (cholesterolemia 445 mg/dl, LDL 318 mg/dl, triglycerides 292 mg/dl) to lipid-lowering drugs (atorvastatin 40 mg/day + cholestyramine 4 g/day + Omega3 fatty acids 2 g/day) with the presence of periocular thelasmas.\nA renal biopsy revealed the presence of lipids with a fibrous growth of the interstitium and a percentage increase of sclerotic glomeruli with a diagnosis of LPG evolved into nephrotic syndrome (histology will be published in a manuscript in preparation and when published the reference will be provided).\nIn view of the patient's poor response to pharmacological treatment alone, in July 2005 we decided to associate for the first time in a patient with LPG an LDL-Apheresis protocol (three aphereses in the first two weeks, then one weekly session for two months followed by one apheresis every 15 days) with dextran sulfate columns on the basis of the evidence present in literature for the treatment of the steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. [-]\nDuring the first LDL-apheresis (July 2005) with dextran sulphate columns (Liposorber System - Kaneka\u2122), an anaphylactoid reaction occurred. This complication, as described by Olbricht in 1992 in patients undergoing treatment with ACE inhibitors and an LDL-apheresis regimen with dextran sulphate columns, is due to the inhibition of kininases that metabolize bradikynin [].\nTo avoid stopping the anti-hypertension treatment with ACE-inhibitors we decided to use another LDL-apheresis procedure: the extracorporeal precipitation of LDL-cholesterol induced by heparin in acid pH (HELP System, B. Braun Avitum\u2122 Melsungen Germany). This procedure does not involve complications linked to the use of ACE-inhibitors, following the same protocol previously described.\nThe effects of a single HELP-apheresis on vascular homeostasis is a simultaneous, drastic reduction within two hours of cholesterol (-52%), LDL-cholesterol (-56%), VLDL-cholesterol (-52%), oxLDL (-47%), Lp(a) (-55%), triglycerides (-50%), fibrinogen (-56%), thrombin (-55%), von Willebrand factor (-56%), factor V (-57%), factor VII (-35%), PCR (-56%), plasma viscosity (-14%), erythrocyte aggregability (-60%), and thrombocyte aggregability (-60%). Also reported in the long-term treatment was an increase of HDL-cholesterol (+14%), peripheral muscle oxygenation (+33-50%), coronary flow reserve (+14%), and cerebral CO2 reactivity (+14%) [].\nIn the LDL/fibrinogen apheresis procedure (HELP-apheresis), the plasma is obtained by filtration of the whole blood through a 0.55 \u03bcm pore-size filter and then mixed continuously in a 1:1 ratio with a solution of a 0.2 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.85) containing 100 IU/ml (300,000 UI) of heparin. The pH of the plasma-buffer solution reaches 5.12 and, at this value, the heparin binds the LDL-cholesterol, Lp(a), fibrinogen and triglycerides forming aggregates. These aggregates precipitate and are retained by the precipitate filter. Precipitate filter is a 0.4 \u03bcm pore-size polycarbonate filter from which plasma free from LDL-cholesterol, Lp(a) and fibrinogen is obtained and then passed through an anion exchange filter (heparin absorber) to adsorb excess heparin. The last stage of the system (dialysis filter) restores the physiological pH of the plasma and the balance of the liquids, removing excess fluid by ultrafiltration. The liquid used for dialysis is a sterile solution with a bicarbonate concentration of 35 mmol/l. After the dialysis process, the plasma, purified of lipids and fibrinogen, is returned to the patient mixed with the haematic cell components.\nWe processed 3000 ml of plasma. That means about 1.4 patient plasma volumes in two hours, with HELP machine (Plasmat Futura\u00ae, B. Braun Avitum, Melsungen Germany) and a disposable kit. There were no side effects with the HELP. method, except that the patient had problematic vascular accesses leading to flow problems, So, it became necessary to modify some software parameters (most notably the \"PA minimum\" threshold; software version 2.06.01) to be able to use a 17G fistula needle for the blood withdrawal and a 20G cannula needle for the blood reinfusion during the procedure. With this configuration, the flows were relatively moderate for an LDL-apheresis (blood flow of 50 ml/min and plasma flow of 20 ml/min), to complete the treatment target of 3000 ml. After some procedures we proceeded with the use of an 18G fistula needle in re-entry, maintaining a 17G fistula needle for drawing, obtaining flows that were definitely higher (blood flow of 80-100 ml/min and plasma flows of 25-30 ml/min). By increasing the flows, there was a marked reduction in the duration of the individual procedure, super-imposable to that of a patient with good vascular accesses.\nAfter two months of treatment with LDL-apheresis (10 procedures), the laboratory data showed a progressive increase of albuminemia (from 3.39 to 3.70 g/dl) with partial remission of proteinuria (from 3.3 to 2 expressed as urine protein to creatinine ratio. A ratio of 0.1 is normal - protein and creatinine are expressed in mg/dl); and a progressive decline in creatininemia (from 1.9 to 1.6 mg/dl). The patient's anemia was improving and her arterial pressure was well under control with a reduction of the pharmacological dose, compared to two months earlier. There was also a significant drop in the mean values of TG (from 285 to 231 mg/dl) and LDL-Cholesterol (from 178 to 158 mg/dl) with reduction of xanthelasma. Pre-apheresis fibrinogen and Lp(a) mean values did not show a significant reduction. Considering the patient's clinical condition improvement, we decided to reduce the statins dosage (from 40 to 20 mg/die) continuing LDL-apheresis protocol of one session every two weeks.\nFour months after aphaeretic treatment (15 procedures), the patient's albuminemia values were maintained (3.70 g/dl), her creatinine (1.3 mg/dl) and proteinuria (ratio 1.3) were reduced and her arterial pressure was stabilized (120-80 mmHg). There was a further reduction of LDL-cholesterol (105 mg/dl) and TG (134 mg/dl) mean values, with a suspension of cholestyramine and Omega-3 fatty acids treatment and a further reduction of the xanthelasmas. The LDL-Apheresis session was reduced to one session every three weeks.\nAfter ten months (25 procedures) the laboratory data were as follows: creatinine 1.6 mg/dl, albuminemia 4.30 g/dl, proteinuria (ratio 0.13), LDL-cholesterol 106 mg/dl and TG 154 mg/dl. The values of Lp(a) and fibrinogen are unchanged (Figure , ).\nAfter two years of follow up, with a maintenance treatment of one LDL-apheresis session every three weeks in the last period, the mean biochemical values were: cholesterol 199 mg/dl, LDL-cholesterol 110 mg/dl, HDL-cholesterol 76 mg/dl, TG 112 mg/dl, fibrinogen 381 mg/dl, creatininemia 1.5 mg/dl, Proteinuria ratio 0.9, arterial pressure 120-80 mmHg. The pharmacological therapy is unchanged.\nThe sequence of the ApoE gene made in 2007 showed that the patient was homozygous for epsilon-2 allele (polymorphism E2/2 with Cys112 and Cys158 in the mature protein) and heterozygous for a novel mutation in exon 4: c.502 C>T [Arg 150>Cys of mature protein]. The mutant Apo E (ApoEMODENA) expresses a new residue of Cys in place of an Arg. This new cysteine residue could form a disulphide bridge with the other Cys residue of the E2 isoform resulting in ApoE polymerization (dominant negative effect). This phenomenon is probably the cause of both dyslipidemia and lipid thrombi in the glomerular capillaries [].",

Initial laboratory investigations revealed a haemoglobin of 117 g/L, white cell count of 11.57 \u00d7 109/L (neutrophil count 9.26 \u00d7 109/L), C-reactive protein 11 mg/L, and creatinine 96 \u03bcmol/L [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 72 mL/min].\nThe primary components of the admission differential diagnosis included: infective endocarditis, aortic valve dehiscence or thrombosis, congestive cardiac failure of alternative cause, and pneumonia.\nUrgent echocardiography was performed which demonstrated dehiscence of the aortic valve with mild aortic regurgitation. On 2D echo imaging, a hypoechoic tract could be visualized from the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) to the RA (Figure ). The suspicion of a Gerbode defect was confirmed on colour flow mapping, with a large jet demonstrated between the two chambers (Figure and C).\nComputerized tomography (CT) revealed a complex aortic root pseudoaneurysm with LVOT to RA fistulation and a large left-to-right shunt (Figure and B).\nThree peripheral blood cultures taken on admission returned positive for Staphylococcus warneri, a coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. Treatment with intravenous gentamicin, vancomycin, and rifampicin was initiated and after 10 days of therapy, he underwent a surgical aortic valve replacement and LV\u2013RA fistula repair. After 1 month in hospital, he was discharged home, and 2 months later was back on the golf-course, albeit with a very limited swing on account of his recent sternotomy.",

        "Patient Note": "A 12-year-old girl was admitted to our unit with syncope. She had fainted after climbing the stairs. She was born to non-consanguineous parents. Her history was negative for systemic disease, and she denied taking any medicine or exposure to toxins. She had experienced two syncope attacks during exercise, four months previously.\nBy physical examination, her the heart rate was 95 beats min-1, respiratory rate was 25 min-1, and blood pressure was 90/55 mmHg. Body temperature was 37 \u00b0C. While she was awake, the respiratory sounds were diminished. Laboratory examinations showed leukocytosis (13.5000 mm3) and elevated acute phase reactants (erythrocyte sedimentation rate: 83 mm/h; C-reactive protein: 8.2 mg/dL). Chest X-ray showed bilateral diffuse pneumonic consolidation and mild cardiomegaly. Except for a stable ST depression, electrocardiography (ECG) was normal (). Echocardiography showed thickening of the mitral and aortic valves and mild mitral valve insufficiency. The left ventricle was mildly dilated, but systolic function was within normal limits (the ejection fraction was 68%). The troponin-1 level was high (66 mcg/dL, upper limit: 0.04 mcg/dL). Influenza A virus DNA was detected by respiratory viral panel screening. The toxicologic screening was negative. Throat, blood, and urine cultures were negative. Antistreptolysin O titer was within normal limits. Cranial computed tomography and electroencephalography were normal. We did not detect any arrhythmia by 24 h ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Intravenous immunoglobulin was given for treatment of myocarditis. We started combined wide-spectrum antibiotics and antiviral oseltamire treatments. At the third day, she had no complaint; acute phase reactants and cardiac markers were negative. Normal cardiac size and clear lung fields were detected by chest X-ray. We stopped giving antibiotics after ruling out bacterial infection. However, there was a stable ST depression in the inferior leads by ECG. Coronary angiography by computed tomography displayed a suspected atheroma plague in the left anterior descending (LAD) aorta. Meanwhile, she had experienced another syncope attack. ECG showed an ST depression in the inferior leads, but the cardiac marker was negative. A cardiovascular stress test showed significant ST depression in the inferior leads (). Conventional coronary angiography revealed a significant occlusion of the LAD artery and circumflex artery (). High serum levels of total cholesterol (756 mg/dL) and LD-cholesterol (LDL-C) (556 mg/dL) were noticed. Carotid artery Doppler imaging showed moderate occlusion in both carotid arteries. When the patient\u2019s medical history was re-taken, we found that her grandmother had been diagnosed with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) and underwent a coronary bypass surgery at 50-years-of-age. Her parents and 4-year-old sister\u2019s blood analyses showed hypercholesterolemia, which was suggesting of HeFH. Diagnosis of HoFH was made in our case based on elevated plasma cholesterol levels, premature CAD, and positive family history. Her coagulation and thrombus panel and thyroid function tests were normal, and metabolic screening tests were negative. She had no tendon xanthomas. A coronary bypass surgery was performed between the left internal mammary arteries (LIMA) and LAD. Rosuvastatin, ezetimibe (a calcium-canal blocker drug), and aspirin treatments were started. After 1 year, she was in good condition and had no complaint. Her electrocardiography was normal. On echocardiogram, mitral and aortic regurgitations persisted. The LDL cholesterol level was slightly decreased (350-450 mg/dL), and we have planned lipid apheresis. She was consulted by the Pediatric Gastroenterology and Transplantation committee at our hospital. Meanwhile, the combined and high doses of ezetimibe and rosuvastatin therapy have resulted in a 37% reduction in her serum LDL level. She has remained free from treatment-related adverse responses, and CVD during follow-up and her parents did not accept liver transplantation. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents.",

At the first consultation in the emergency department, she complained of massive abdominal pain since the night before admission, which did not respond to analgesic drugs. Because of the patient\u2019s history of bariatric surgery and the suspicion of SBO, a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, which was inconclusive at the first look with multiple differential diagnoses. It showed a thickening of the wall of the ascending colon and a diverticulum of the duodenum with semisolid contents. The patient was then referred to our hospital for further treatment.\nIn our emergency department, the patient\u2019s general condition was reduced because of pain and signs of diffuse peritonitis. The vital signs showed a blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg and an accelerated pulse (120 bpm), a respiratory rate of 25/min and a normal body temperature. The blood results showed a leukocytosis with only slightly elevated C-reactive protein (14 mg/l). The CT scan was reviewed and revealed the presence of retroperitoneal and parapancreatic fluid with some air bubbles, which could also be seen in an additional abdominal sonography. Further a thickening of the colon ascendens was found (). A perforated duodenal diverticulum was likely and suspected. The thickening of the ascending colon was interpreted as an accompanying colitis.\nAttributable to the reduced condition of the patient with little response to opioids, signs of diffuse peritonitis and our interpretation of the imaging, we decided to perform an explorative transverse laparotomy in the upper abdomen. Although the right colic flexure was mobilized, the exposure of the duodenum was difficult and very limited. However, a hard resistance could be palpated. After a Kocher maneuver and exposing the duodenum and the pancreas dorsally, we were then able to dissect the duodenal diverticulum. The diverticular wall was incised and a biliary stone of the size of ~7 \u00d7 4cm was exposed and removed (). Sutures then reattached the duodenal wall. A T-drain was placed intraduodenally, an Easy-Flow drain paraduodenally ( and ). Postoperatively, the patient was admitted to the ICU for initial surveillance. An empiric intravenous antibiotic therapy with Piperacillin/Tazobactam was initiated. After one night, the patient could be transferred to the normal ward in stable condition.\nThe postoperative course was uneventful. Pain was controlled with basis analgesia and slowly she returned to a normal diet. Inflammatory markers were declining and antibiotics could soon be stopped. Ten days postoperatively, a fistulography showed a persistent retroperitoneal collection of 3 \u00d7 3 cm so the drains were left in situ. Two days later, the patient was discharged from the hospital in proper general condition but with extraduodenal drains still in place.\nOne week after dismissal, the patient felt well with normal appetite and a regular intestinal passage. The fistulography showed a significant reduction of the collection so the T-drain was removed. Two weeks later, she still felt irritated by the last remaining Easy-Flow drainage, which continued showing some turbid liquid and was therefore left in situ. Intestinal passage was unchanged and there were no signs of inflammation. Another 2 weeks later, the drain fell out by accident. Seven weeks postoperatively, still no signs of inflammation, we were able to finish our treatment.",

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 143.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 143.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 143.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 143.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 143.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 106.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 106.0 mmol.

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 25.0 mmol.

The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 25.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 25.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 143.0 mEq/L - (106.0 mEq/L + 25.0 mEq/L) = 12.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 12.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 12.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 12.0 - 12 = 0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 0 mEq/L.",

Cardiovascular and lung exams were unremarkable. Abdominal exam showed a soft and non-tender abdomen with normal bowel sounds. Complete blood count (CBC) revealed a low hemoglobin of 11.6 g/dL and a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 63 fL consistent with microcytic anemia. Otherwise, the patient had a normal white blood cell (WBC) of 6.6 \u00d7 109/L and platelets of 167 \u00d7 109/L. Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) was within normal limits: Sodium 143 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, chloride 106 mmol/L, CO2 25 mmol/L, glucose 121 mg/dL, creatinine 0.81 mg/dL, BUN 12 mg/dL, calcium 9.4 mg/dL, total protein 6.5 g/dL, albumin 4.2 g/dL, total bilirubin 1.0 mg/dL, AST 12 U/L, ALT 12 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase 100 U/L.\nAn esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed to investigate the cause of dysphagia. EGD revealed a normal appearing esophagus, patchy erythema in the gastric antrum, normal appearing gastric body, and normal appearing duodenum (). A gastric biopsy was obtained, and histologic examination revealed glandular atrophy with acellular, eosinophilic deposits in the lamina propria and submucosa. Congo red stain revealed apple-green birefringence on polarized light consistent with gastric amyloidosis.\nFurther workup followed to evaluate the etiology of amyloidosis. Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) did not show a monoclonal (M) band. Urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) did reveal the presence of proteinuria, but also failed to show an M band. Immunofixation showed elevated free kappa light chains of 104.90 mg/dL and an elevated free Kappa/Lambda ratio of 156.57.

The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 143.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 143.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 143.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 143.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 143.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 143.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 106.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 106.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 106.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 106.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 106.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 106.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 25.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 25.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 25.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 25.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 25.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 25.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 143.0 mEq/L - (106.0 mEq/L + 25.0 mEq/L) = 12.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 12.0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in 12.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 12.0 - 12 = 0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 0 mEq/L.\nPlugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get 0 mEq/L / -1.0 mEq/L = 0. The patient's delta ratio is 0.",

He denied chest pain, regurgitation, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hematochezia, or melena. His past medical history was significant for essential hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic hepatitis B infection, hypothyroidism, and sarcoidosis. The patient\u2019s past surgical history was significant for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, bilateral cataract surgery, and multiple tooth extractions. Family history was noncontributory. Home medications included aspirin, quinapril, atenolol, levothyroxine, and entecavir. He denied using tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs.\nOn physical examination, the patient appeared chronically ill and cachectic. Vital signs demonstrated a temperature of 36.8 \u00b0C, blood pressure of 128/60 mmHg, heart rate of 65 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. Cardiovascular and lung exams were unremarkable. Abdominal exam showed a soft and non-tender abdomen with normal bowel sounds. Complete blood count (CBC) revealed a low hemoglobin of 11.6 g/dL and a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 63 fL consistent with microcytic anemia. Otherwise, the patient had a normal white blood cell (WBC) of 6.6 \u00d7 109/L and platelets of 167 \u00d7 109/L. Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) was within normal limits: Sodium 143 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, chloride 106 mmol/L, CO2 25 mmol/L, glucose 121 mg/dL, creatinine 0.81 mg/dL, BUN 12 mg/dL, calcium 9.4 mg/dL, total protein 6.5 g/dL, albumin 4.2 g/dL, total bilirubin 1.0 mg/dL, AST 12 U/L, ALT 12 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase 100 U/L.\nAn esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed to investigate the cause of dysphagia. EGD revealed a normal appearing esophagus, patchy erythema in the gastric antrum, normal appearing gastric body, and normal appearing duodenum (). A gastric biopsy was obtained, and histologic examination revealed glandular atrophy with acellular, eosinophilic deposits in the lamina propria and submucosa. Congo red stain revealed apple-green birefringence on polarized light consistent with gastric amyloidosis.\nFurther workup followed to evaluate the etiology of amyloidosis. Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) did not show a monoclonal (M) band. Urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) did reveal the presence of proteinuria, but also failed to show an M band. Immunofixation showed elevated free kappa light chains of 104.90 mg/dL and an elevated free Kappa/Lambda ratio of 156.57. At this point, the patient was referred to a hematology/oncology specialist for a bone marrow biopsy.

After initial resuscitation with IV fluids, and potassium replacement, the patient's blood sugar stabilized to 172 mg/dL random; however, metabolic acidosis and hypokalemia persisted. Then, the possibility of dRTA was thought of. Anion gap was calculated as Na \u2013 [HCO3 + Cl], which was normal: 137 \u2013 [12.1 + 116] = 8.9 mEq/L. Furthermore, urine pH was 6.0 even at a serum pH of 7.20. The patient was diagnosed as dRTA in view of normal anion gap metabolic acidosis with hypokalemia with inability to acidify urine in the presence of systemic metabolic acidosis. Meanwhile, the patient started tolerating oral intake and was started on oral feeds with pre-meal subcutaneous regular insulin. Subsequently, the patient was put on oral sodium bicarbonate tablets at a dose of 2 mEq/kg and oral potassium replacement. His metabolic acidosis and hypokalemia improved markedly.

We add the the number of years of age of the patient to the psi score, making the current total 0 + 25.0 = 25.0.\nBecause the patient is female, we subtract 10 points from the current total, making the current total 25.0 - 10 = 15.0.\nThe patient is reported to be a nursing home resident and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 15.0 + 10 = 25.0.\nNeoplastic disease is reported to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 25.0.\nLiver disease history is reported to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 25.0.\nCHF History is reported to be present for the patient and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 25.0 + 10 = 35.0.\nCerebrovascular disease history is reported to be present for the patient and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 35.0 + 10 = 45.0.\nRenal Disease History is reported to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 45.0.\nAltered Mental Status is reported to be present for the patient and so we add 20 points to the score, making the current total 45.0 + 20 = 65.0.\nPleural effusion on x-ray is reported to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 65.0.\nThe patient's pulse is 128.0 beats per minute. The pulse is greater or equal to than 125 beats per minute, and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 65.0 + 10 = 75.0.\nThe patient's temperature is 40.1 degrees celsius. The patient's temperature is greater than 39.9 degrees celsius and so we add 15 points to the score, making the current total 75.0 + 15 = 90.0.\nThe patient's pH is 7.28. The patient's pH is less than 7.35, and so we add 30 points to the score, making the current total 90.0 + 30 = 120.0.\nThe patient's respiratory rate is 25.0 breaths per minute. The patient's respiratory rate is less than 30 breaths per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total score at 120.0.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 75.0 mm Hg. The patient's systolic blood pressure is less than 90 mm Hg and so we add 20 points to the score, making current total 120.0 + 20 = 140.0.\nThe concentration of BUN is 26.75 mg/dL. The patient's BUN is less than 30 mg/dL, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 140.0.\nThe concentration of sodium is 135.0 mmol/L. The patient's sodium is greater than or equal to 130 mmol/L, and so we do not add any points to the scor, keeping the total at 140.0.\nThe concentration of glucose is 13.21 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 13.21 mmol. To convert 13.21 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 13.21 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.013 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.013 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 2.342 g glucose. To convert 2.342 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 2.342 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 2342.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 2342.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 234.2 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 13.21 mmol glucose/L converts to 234.2 mg glucose/dL. The patient's glucose concentration is less than or equal to than 250 mg/dL, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 140.0.\nThe patient's hemocratit is 28.0 %. The patient's hemocratit is less than 30%, and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 140.0 + 10 = 150.0.\nThe patient's partial pressure of oxygen is 56.0 mm Hg. The patient's partial pressure of oxygen is less than 60 mm Hg, and so we add 150.0 points to the score, making the current total 150.0 + 10 = 160.0.\nThe patient's PSI score is 160.0.",

For one point to be given, the patient's mean arterial pressure must be less than 70 mm Hg, making the current total 2 + 1 = 3.\nThe patient's glasgow coma score is not reported so we take it to be 15. Because the patient's glasgow coma score is 15, we add 0 points to the score, keeping the score at 3.\n The concentration of bilirubin is 2.43 \u00b5mol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of bilirubin from \u00b5mol to mg. The mass of bilirubin is 2.43 \u00b5mol. To convert 2.43 \u00b5mol of bilirubin to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 2.43 \u00b5mol bilirubin * 1e-06 mol/\u00b5mol = 2.43e-06 mol bilirubin. To convert from mol bilirubin to grams, multiply by the molar mass 584.66 g/mol, which will give 2.43e-06 mol bilirubin * 584.66 g/mol = 0.001 g bilirubin. To convert 0.001 g of bilirubin to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.001 g bilirubin * 1000.0 mg/g = 1.0 mg bilirubin. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 1.0 mg bilirubin/10.0 dL = 0.1 mg bilirubin/dL. The concentration value of 2.43 \u00b5mol bilirubin/L converts to 0.1 mg bilirubin/dL. Because the patient's bilirubin concentration is less than 1.2 mg/dL, we add 0 points to the score, keeping the score at 3.\n The patient's concentration of platelet is 157000.0 count/\u00b5L. Because the patient's platelet count is at least 150*10\u00b3/\u00b5L, we do not any points to the score, keeping the current score at 3.\nThe concentration of creatinine is 3.12 \u00b5mol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of creatinine from \u00b5mol to mg. The mass of creatinine is 3.12 \u00b5mol. To convert 3.12 \u00b5mol of creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 3.12 \u00b5mol creatinine * 1e-06 mol/\u00b5mol = 3.12e-06 mol creatinine. To convert from mol creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 3.12e-06 mol creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.000353 g creatinine. To convert 0.000353 g of creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000353 g creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 0.353 mg creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 0.353 mg creatinine/10.0 dL = 0.035 mg creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 3.12 \u00b5mol creatinine/L converts to 0.035 mg creatinine/dL.

        "Patient Note": "A 56 year old male with a history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus was admitted to the hospital three weeks ago for ischemic stroke. He presented with sudden onset left-sided weakness and slurred speech. Upon admission, imaging confirmed a right middle cerebral artery stroke. TPA was administered and the patient was admitted to the stroke unit. During hospitalization, the patient developed fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. Blood cultures were obtained and empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy started for presumed sepsis of unclear source. Due to the patient's acutely deteriorating clinical status, a central venous catheter was surgically inserted for hemodynamic monitoring and administration of antibiotics and vasopressor support. The patient is being closely followed by the stroke, infectious disease, and critical care teams. Neurological function has been gradually improving. Antibiotic therapy has been narrowed per culture results and the patient has been hemodynamically stabilized. He is able to ambulate around the room. The patient has no history of prior pneumonia, DVT or PE, heart failure, myocardial infarction, malignancy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or inflammatory bowel disease. The patient recently underwent extensive workup for thrombophilic risk factors, which revealed elevated serum homocysteine and positive anticardiolipin antibody. Evaluation of Factor V Leiden, prothrombin 20210A, and lupus anticoagulant were negative. There is no family history of thrombosis. The patient has no recent history of trauma or fractures. BMI is 23.4 kg/m^2. On physical exam, heart and lung sounds are normal. Lower extremities are normal with no edema or varicose veins. The patient will remain hospitalized for ongoing management and monitoring.",
