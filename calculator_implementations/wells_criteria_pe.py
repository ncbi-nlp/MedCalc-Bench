The criteria for the Wells' Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism score are listed below:

1. Clinical signs and symptoms of DVT: No = 0 points, Yes = +3 points
2. PE is #1 diagnosis OR equally likely: No = 0 points, Yes = +3 points
3. Heart rate > 100: No = 0 points, Yes = +1.5 points
4. Immobilization at least 3 days OR surgery in the previous 4 weeks: No = 0 points, Yes = +1.5 points
5. Previous, objectively diagnosed PE or DVT: No = 0 points, Yes = +1.5 points
6. Hemoptysis: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point
7. Malignancy with treatment within 6 months or palliative: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point

The total score is calculated by summing the points for each criterion.
